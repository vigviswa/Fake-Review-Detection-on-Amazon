I had just completed a tourist grade wreck dive (Miss Opportunity) when I cracked open Shadow Divers for the first time.  This book reached out, grabbed me by my BC, yanked me in and didn't let go until it was finished.  It is a well-crafted and perfectly presented account of 2 men who overcame a deep and competitive dislike for one another to unravel a 250 foot deep mystery that ultimately became a life's obsession for both of them. Shadow Divers takes the reader into the life & unbelievably well-controlled mind of the deep wreck diver and further into the shared philosophy of 2 men who HAD to reveal the identity of a mysterious sunken U-boat off the New Jersey coast.  It is written so well that even if the reader has absolutely no interest in scuba diving, has no prior knowlege of U-boats & associated World War II history, and has never even snorkeled a day is his life, he won't be able to put it down. The author winds the story expertly through the lives of the young men as they grow older and mature into expert researchers and master diving skills that most other divers think impossible; the effects that this obsession had on their lives & families; on their friendship; on the world class diver boat captain as he succumbs to losing his grip on diving & life to alcohol; through the deaths of several divers as the mystery unfolds, and finally through the discovered history of this U-boat and the men that were and are still aboard today.<br /><br />This is an amazing story, expertly told.  Read it.","2008-12-13","2008","Books"

This book is a must read.    The information contained within is nothing new. Like his other books, he piggybacks off of the research that other people have done. He treks the reader across familiar intellectual terrain like self-fulfilling prophecy effects, Hofstede's dimensions, Albion's Seed, social/cultural capital, linguistic relativism, and white privilege, to name a few sights. And, like his other books, Gladwell is a masterful storyteller in Outlier.     But there is also a deeper meaning in this book. It is a gem.

Think again! Parents can and should take responsibility for preventing these plagues on our children's health. Nature's design is perfect. We just need to learn how to honor and respect it.<br /><br />It is very difficult for me to write a review for such an amazing and significant composition as Healing Our Children. I feel like I could never do it justice, but at the same time, it is as imperative that those who have read it should share what they know with others.<br /><br />Ramiel Nagel details the steps future parents, pregnant mothers, and parents of small children can take to dramatically decrease the chances of such diseases and defects. He includes dietary guidelines for preconception, pregnancy, lactation and early childhood that will give the greatest chances for successfully raising healthy, happy, beautiful, robust children. He unlocks these secrets from their hiding places in traditional societies that have flourished, free from illness, for millennia.<br /><br />You owe it to your children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews and cousins to research these simple methods for avoiding the suffering that is all too common in our modern society. Medical advances have done nothing to stem the tide of birth defects, infertility and childhood diseases. If anything, they have only expedited it by ignoring the laws Nature has clearly laid out for mindful traditional cultures to follow.<br /><br />I appreciate Nagel's honesty in providing this important work. It is up to each of us to implement these strategies to heal our children.","2008-12-13","2008","Books"

His injury has, in essence, put him on life support. He may be breathing, even living as long as he's plugged in. If they pull that plug,we lose him.&#34;  Annie and Quint, childhood sweethearts that are best friends first. Growing up together they bond through their shared childhood and that friendship blooms into attraction that soon grows into a deep forever love. Annie is working hard to become a teacher whilst Quint is chasing his lifelong dream of becoming a Shortstop for the Yankees. The first third of this novel we become immersed in a beautiful story of passion, love and dreams coming true. It's uplifting, heart warming and idyllic. Their love although they have ups and downs seems ironclad and durable no matter what life throws at them. Annie struggles at first with her role as wife to be of the new face in the Yankee team, yet is devoted 100% to Quint's dream. Changing her plans, goals and aspirations to put Quint first Annie truly is his number one fan. He is living the dream, playing for the Yankees with the woman of his dreams soon to be his wife. Their future is golden.  The second third of the book follows the systematic shut down of everything that we have grown to live in Quint. He slowly but surely breaks down and closes himself off from everything good in his life. Trapped in his anger and fear after a tragic injury the descent into depression is quick and brutal. It's heartbreaking to read as he severs all connections to those who love him, pushing them away as he is no longer the person he was before. His reasonings come from the best of intentions, his motives  honourable but his actions are shocking. Annie is so strong. She keeps going back for more emotional punishment from the man she loves with her whole heart as she just won't give up on him. She is awe inspiring and my favourite character in this story. The pain she endures for him and the pain she willing accepts as she empathises with his sense of loss makes her my stand out character.  As their childhood dream shatters and their futures take an alternative path the remaining third of the story shows how individually Annie and Quint develop without leaning on each other. Annie discovers who she has grown to be, finding her own two feet without being in Quints shadow. Having hit rock bottom Quint also finds himself again. Without the two loves in his life who is he? Can our childhood sweetheart find their way back to one another? Can Annie forgive the man he became in his darkest hour? Can Quint embrace his alternate reality and find happiness with what he has, not what could have been?  This is a gut wrenching, heart twisting story that will make you happy then sad then....no spoilers here! The writing style is full bodied and descriptive so being clueless about baseball I still felt like I was part of the game. The friendships,the parents and of course Lance all made this a wonderful read.","2015-08-14","2015","Books"

The patterns are all quite easy to follow and do not require too many skills beyond a beginner/intermediate level.  The down side is that most of the items are kind of shapeless, which is OK for some garments but can be limiting for others.  All the same this is a good book for new knitters to jump in to a project and create and complete a garment without feeling confused by too many shaping instructions.  For new knitters I really recommend the Vogue Knitting hard cover book.  It has instructions for almost every stitch and is presented in a really clear manner.

I have always had a fondness for miniature sized decks as I have small hands and they are easy for me to handle.  The cards in this deck measure 3.1 x 2.9 x 1.9 inches; are printed on a heavy card stock and have a very glossy laminate coating.<br /><br />The card backs are lush with green vines, a centered sun, two crescent moons, and two small people juggling.  The art work is clever and done in a way that makes them fully reversible.<br /><br />The cards are unusual in that they are black with colorfully illustrated majors, pips, and courts.  The majors are numbered 0-21 with 0 being the Fool, 8 for Justice, and 11 for Strength.  The Court cards consist of Pages, Knights, Queens and Kings.<br /><br />The writing on the cards is English and the numbers are written with roman numerals; all of which is in white which is easily legible even for my on the verge of bifocal eyesight! The only borders on the cards are the tips which denote the suits; yellow tips for swords, green tips for pentacles, blue tips for cups, red tips for wands, and purple tips for the majors.<br /><br />This darling deck is suitable for all ages and I would recommend this deck for children who wish to read the tarot.  Sneaky mice, greedy pigs, people, and lush plant life are all depicted in these cards. Cards that could be disturbing in other decks do not seem frightening in this one.  For instance the gentleman in the 10 of Swords card looks rather like a porcupine and has a perplexed expression on his face as he looks around at the 10 swords sticking out of his back.  The 5 of swords shows a mouse chasing another well dressed mouse and although he has managed to pierce the mouse with on of his swords the chase continues!  The death card shows a winged skull on top of an hourglass with three butterflies circling the card.  Our naked lovers in the lovers card are discreetly covered Adam and Eve style with a green flowering vine, and although the woman in the strength card is fully naked, the picture is drawn in a childlike manner so her nudity is a non issue to me.<br />The next great thing about this deck is the English only companion book.  Yes, a  little 88 page bound book the size of the cards with a hard cardboard cover.  This tiny book has a short introduction of tarot, an explanation of the major arcana, and the suits of the minor arcana.  It is illustrated with black and white pictures of each of the cards and provides both upright and reversed interpretations that for the most part make sense with the correlating picture.  A paper mat is provided with spread information, mine quickly got lost.<br />When I need a deck to throw in my purse, I grab this one!  When I want a direct too the point answer to my question, I choose this deck.  When my eyes are tired of the busy, cluttered images in my other decks, I choose this deck for respite!  This great little deck continues to be one of my all time favorites.<br /><br />This miniature deck can be purchased alone or in a kit with the addition of Palm Reading information.ouse with on of his swords the chase continues!

I didn't think there would be enough to write a book on.<br /><br />Kristal Wick has opened my eyes to a whole new side of bead making. And the way she has put this book together is very easy to follow. I can't wait to try some of her techniques. There are many ways to make fabric beads.<br /><br />This book combines a wide variety of techniques like; beading, quilting, fiber arts scrap booking and mixed media to create some beautiful jewelry.<br /><br />In the beginning of the book she tells about what kinds of fabrics you can use and a little about them.<br /><br />She also gives a good list of what you will need to make fabric beads. And a lot of the items you probably already have in your home. Especially if you are already a crafter.<br /><br />There are a lot of things she tells you about in this book that you can use for the surface design and embellishment. Everything from a battery- operated toothbrush to hole punches and die cuts. When I read through this book there were things she mentioned that I have never heard of before. One of them is the Tee Juice fabric markers. They looked like bingo stampers. And \\""Paint sticks\\"", they are probably messy.<br /><br />After she does a great job on listing materials and tools, she moves on to surface design on fabric. Kristal tells how to do many techniques for putting designs on fabric. I am so excited to try some of them. She has really peaked my interest.<br /><br />She actually takes you through, step-by-step , each of 18 different techniques. With her clear instructions and step-by-step photography, you can't go wrong!<br /><br />One technique I found to be interesting (of many) the salting technique. It is pretty simple with cool results.<br /><br />Then the fun part starts. She then goes through cutting the fabric, rolling the beads, dipping, and how to stablize the beads. All with well explained directions and great photos to go with them.<br /><br />You will definitely be able to make a fabric bead of some kind after you've read Kristal's new book.<br /><br />In the next section, she shows you many fabric \\""recipes\\"", as she calls them to create beads using different fabric choices, texture and surface treatments. She had really pushed the imagination here.<br /><br />I loved the Talisman Message Beads, they are so awesome. And the embossed leather beads are really cool.<br /><br />The next section is devoted to beautiful projects using the many techniques and fabrics throughout the book.<br /><br />Each project gives a list of supplies, step-by-step instructions and photos of the final product.<br /><br />The projects go through the color palette with vibrant, rich colors. I absolutely love what she did with colors.<br /><br />The last section is a brilliant gallery of jewelry inspiration. Many beautiful works of art to give you inspiration.

Tibbetts was at the Pima Air and Space Museum in Tucson to talk about his life and his book was available. I have a photo of him signing my book, yet I didn't read it for nine years. That was my loss.    Paul Tibbetts is an authentic American hero. I recetly read Masters of the Sky which is a detailed and exhaustive recounting of the work of the Eighth Air Force during WW2. In it, Tibbetts is mentioned as a pilot who led early raids in Europe and North Africa. He is best known for being the pilot of the Enola Gay, the plane to drop the first atomic bomb in WW2. Yet, long before that, he was an authentic hero and pilot who warriors such as Gen. Curtis Lemay had appreciated and wanted in their command.    His autobiography testifies to the kind of man he was. Proud, talented and a patriot of the first order.     He got screwed over from time to time by the the politics of the military. Yet, he accepted that as the cost of doing business as a career officer.    He saw it all in WW2, from the early raids on Europe as a member of the 8th Air Force to the final dropping of the first atom bomb on Hiroshima as a member of the 509th. For those who enjoy first person accounts, you can't do much better than this book from a man who saw it all.

Pathetically desperate for human contact with the outside world, Carl signs up with \\""The Serial Letter Company\\"" and starts receiving made up love letters from \\""Molly\\"", who ends up caring more about Carl than the real people in his life. As the endless weeks go by, it's the daily letters and packages from \\""Molly\\"" that keep Carl going rather than the spotty correspondence from the woman he loves.<br /><br />As to be expected, Carl comes to want to know who \\""Molly\\"" really is.

Maybe \\""Molly\\"" is actually a man, a writer having to concoct these fake love letters in order to pay the bills. \\""Molly\\"" may even be, *gasp*, a \\""Cullud Pusson\\"".<br /><br />Okay, I'm going to spoil it for you a little bit and tell you she's not.

This is a book that is at turns challenging, upsetting, hopeful and inspiring. While reading it I wept, not only for the lost childhood of Mitch Rutledge, but for the fact that his story is repeated in so many lives in prisons across this land. I am no &#34;bleeding heart&#34; liberal, thinking that society can cure all social ills with good will and funding. Yet, I must confess to having at times a heart that has hardened towards those who have committed crimes. This volume is a testimony that a person can not only change, but find meaning in a world where hope is easily extinguished. That hope is also seen to be transmitted in the lives of committed Christians who reach out to Mitch with genuine and enduring friendship and love. I highly recommend this book and intend to see that friends of mine involved in prison outreach get a copy.","2015-08-14","2015","Books"

I was totally absorbed into the world that Virgina Boecker has created. I really enjoyed that Elizabeth Grey is a character who I think really evolves in some unique ways.<br /><br />What I really found unique was the fact that she was a witch hunter who finds herself in a really weird situation. She is a very good witch hunter who has been targeted to be executed because Elizabeth happens to have herbs on her that typically belong to a witch. She really doesn’t want to go to prison or get Caleb in trouble who is her friend. Caleb and Elizabeth find that things are going to get complicated when Elizabeth is arrested for practicing witchcraft. She is not one though.<br /><br />When Elizabeth is saved by a very famous wizard, Nicholas. So she goes with him.  Elizabeth finds herself with people, witches and wizards who have had their lives uprooted by the laws that the governments. Elizabeth gets to know a lot more than she ever wanted to about these people. She starts to question a lot of things that she thought was right and wrong. The line becomes very blurred for her.<br /><br />We learn that Nicholas needs Elizabeth’s help to get better. He has been cursed. Of course there is always a prophecy that some think involves her. Nothing is ever simple for Elizabeth and her new friends. She also has some unresolved issues regarding her friend, Caleb. Elizabeth gets mad at Caleb because he doesn’t understand how he is being manipulated. She feels like everything happens for a reason. We also learn that something that happened in Elizabeth’s past is the clue to figuring out the prophecy and finds the final piece of what she needs to get the tablet.<br /><br />Elizabeth finds that things are not so simple. Life evolves. Other people have motives for doing the things that they do in life. Also we learn that the King was duped into believing that Elizabeth had feelings. This causes Elizabeth to get mad at her former boss. Everyone has motives and desires. He wants what he wants. Magic needs to be let loose, but he wants to control it and those people that use it.<br /><br />This had a great conclusion. I really truly enjoyed this book so much. I can’t wait for the sequel.<br /><br />Rating: 4.5 Heartsrmer boss. Everyone has motives and desires. He wants what he wants.

Do you teach writing in an ESL classroom?<br /><br />Of the ten or so textbooks that I browsed through for additional materials for an academic writing class, this book stood out. Featuring clear explanations, short readings, and concise writing activities, this book seems almost pitch perfect for intermediate ESL students and IEP programs. This fine University of Michigan textbook gently and systematically introduces English language learners to effective techniques. As a result, ESL students learn academic writing by actually writing - and revising - short, focused pieces.<br /><br />This relatively new textbook also prepares graduate and international students for more challenging future academic work. In Focus, therefore, naturally complements the classic Academic Writing for Graduate Students, 2d ed.: Essential Tasks and Skills (Michigan Series in English for Academic & Professional Purposes) by John M. Swales and Christine A. Beer Feak for advanced ESL students. I teach two courses using Academic Writing for Graduate Students at USC, and students make clear, significant progress by completing bite-sized writing exercises and analyzing short journal readings. (The teacher's guide, called Commentary for, is also outstanding). Yet sometimes ESL and EFL students sometimes need to take a step back before taking two steps forward. In Focus provides excellent material in those situations too.<br />If you teach academic writing to English language learners, you should at least consider this fine textbook for your courses.","2008-12-13","2008","Books"

While I agree with others, it is a very simple story, but its message is very powerful. It can be considered a little too iconic, but the overall message is very, very good. It makes you remember the true meaning of Christmas. Eddie's story reminded me of just wanting that one special gift that I looked forward to for so long.

The author greatly embroiders the facts of the event: he stereotypes the youth as a friendless science geek (when this is clearly not the case), and he suggests that the Boy Scouts are complicit.    The author, who writes for politically left-leaning magazines, wants to use this book as an occasion to bash the nuclear industry and the Boy Scouts of America. So he presses and pushes and becomes a literary contortionist in an unsuccessful effort to implicate them.    He does this unconvincingly. With the nuclear power industry, he selectively pulls out old 1950s-era industry boosterism and briefly discusses work of the top nuclear scientists of the day. This doesn't really help his case any: in the aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, many credible scientists hoped to find a way this awful power could BENEFIT mankind. . . and of course, the 1950s were a great time of the \\""Science will Make Your Life Bigger and Better\\"" optimism.     With respect to the Boy Scouts, it's pretty simple. David was a scout and enjoyed his scouting experience. He was no strange loner, and he was far beyond the level of knowledge required by the Atomic Energy merit badge. Very strange (to this reviewer), the author pulls out items from the old 1912 British Boy Scout handbook and from the life of scouting's founder, Baden Powell, and holds these up as being a part of contemporary, 21st century American scouting! But then again, the author wants to bash scouting. I am an Eagle Scout ('79) and I have to add that I am dismayed that David found his scouting membership helpful in getting advice and materials: David exploited his scout membership in a way that is clearly wrong. To make my point more clear, what do you think of a scout who uses his uniform to gain access to, and then steal, bank deposits?    If anything, this story shows the importance of having a good family life, concerned parents, and caring teachers. David just didn't have these: so his backyard lab became the vital thing to him.    The story here is a good one, fascinating, and despite the ideological tugs, twitches and jags of the author, a good one to read. Check it out from the library.","2008-12-13","2008","Books"

Personally, I found it to not be useful except as a reference book, and felt it would have benefited from a more aggressive editor.<br /><br />It is packed with information - more than forty-seven diagram and charts of reflexology and acupressure / acupuncture points.  Unfortunately most of this information is not of much practical use.  It is also full of misinformation - a man's `jade stalk' does not have to be a particular shape to gratify a woman, and the author would appear to believe that women only achieve sexual gratification through sexual intercourse.  It contains the usual long, overly detailed explanation of why it bad for men to ejaculate, and the obligatory chapter (eight pages) on thrusting patterns - complete with detailed charts. Like many Chinese books it appears to have been researched and written by a man, and a fair amount of information about women appears suspect to me (I'm a male) - I do not believe it is likely that a jade stalk, however long, would ever enter the cervix. (obviously you do not want to go in the cervix)<br /><br />As far as sexual energetic techniques, the deer technique is as far as the book goes.  It is described very well.  That's it.  I would say this book has fewer relevant bedroom qigong techniques than any other I've read.<br /><br />The text describes eight very simple general chi kung exercises in detail, and mentions but does not describe the crane and tortoise breathing exercises.<br /><br />To give you an idea of the level of detail:<br />- a one page table of Chinese sexual euphemisms  - \\""jade flute\\"", \\""clouds & rain\\""<br />- eight pages of rules for a Taoist sex act [not: when you are tired, after eating, during menstruation, during intense storms, after flying in an airplane, etc.]<br />- Erotic massage (10 pages) - primary, secondary and tertiary erogenous zones of the male & female body, relevant acupuncture points of the hands and feet, the twelve reflex zones of the jade stalk(male) and jade gate (female), reflexology points of the labia ...<br />- determining biological age from the angle of the erection (4 pages)<br />- Techniques to \\""improve\\"" the shape of the `jade stalk'<br /><br />There is a huge overlap between the material in this book and the material in Stephan Chang's Tao of Sexology.

It approaches beauty from such a holistic angle, addressing the typical things we associate with the commerce side of beauty, but focussing on how inner beauty really impacts outer beauty.   Drs. Oz and Roizen look in depth at many things that make a person feel fulfilled, satisfied, and loved, and talk about the science behind how these feelings translate into what we call 'an inner glow.'  They point out that beauty literally comes as much from affection, exercise, and balance (lack of stress, happiness, being of service, building relationships in one's world) as from moisturizer or products for your hair, because the body actually creates its own natural versions of these cosmetic applications when it is well taken care of, including being nourished with affection and balance.  I have to recommend two of the most wonderful books to read in conjunction with You Being Beautiful:  Ariel and Shya Kane's [[ASIN:0071601082 Working on Yourself Doesn't Work: The 3 Simple Ideas That Will Instantaneously Transform Your Life]] and [[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]].  These authors write beautifully about how to take care of your self esteem by not working on yourself anymore (it IS possible!), and how to take care of your community by turning your attention to being of service to others.  These books illuminate exactly what You Being Beautiful suggests in terms of  finding a state of inner nourishment and happiness.

Furthermore, the new fifth edition of Ten Theories of Human Nature contains some helpful improvements which include a new chapter on Buddhism, no chapter on Freud and a revised chapter on Darwinian theories of human nature. Stevenson's writing style is usually critical but he maintains a certain degree of scholarly distance from his subject matter. I've used this work in teaching classes on human nature and will continue to employ the fifth edition. I only have two quibbles with Stevenson, for the most part, besides his chapter on Darwin which I will not comment on now.<br /><br />First, the chapter on the Bible is not written in an objective manner. Compare Haberman's approach to Hinduism or Confucianism with Stevenson's approach to the Bible (Hebrew and Christian): the chapters are as different as night and day. Now I am not saying that there is no legitimate place for critique in a discussion on the biblical religions. But the chapter on the Bible would be improved if Stevenson followed Haberman's lead since the chapters on Confucianism, Hinduism and now Buddhism reflect a sufficient degree of scholarly objectivity. When will the chapter on the Bible be treated similarly?<br /><br />For example, in his attempt to analyze the Hebrew story of Abraham, Stevenson appears to equivocate in one part of his book (page 116). He asks, \\""Even if it [the command to kill Isaac] was only given as a 'test of faith,' what sort of God would play such a trick?\\"" While Genesis 22:1 describes what happened in Abraham's case as a \\""test,\\"" it does not say that God (YHWH) tricked Abraham. I believe that Stevenson equivocates when he moves from \\""test\\"" to \\""trick.\\"" The two words are not synonymous. The implication that God MIGHT have been \\""tricking\\"" Abraham seems unfair to me, even if Stevenson does follow up this comment with the mention of another possible interpretation of the Abrahamic narrative. Then again, he also levels critical words at Martin Heidegger's writing style like \\""Heidegger's language is strange and difficult\\"" (page 183). Maybe Stevenson is not partial in toto after all.<br /><br />Finally, I have found a small technical error in Stevenson's book. On page 130, Stevenson quotes Augustine as saying, \\""I believe in order to understand\\"" (CREDO UT INTELLIGAM); yet that is not what the ancient bishop said. The expression CREDO UT INTELLIGAM was uttered or written by Anselm of Canterbury (the so-called father of Medieval theology). Augustine actually said or wrote the words \\""CREDE, UT INTELLIGAS\\"" (Believe, in order to understand). See Augustine's Sermon 43.7, 9 and [[ASIN:0801020646 Dictionary of Latin and Greek Theological Terms: Drawn Principally from Protestant Scholastic Theology]], pages 85-86.ther possible interpretation of the Abrahamic narrative.

This book had not been on my radar at all, so I’m glad I took the time to read that article!<br /><br />Murder is Bad Manners is the American version of a middle grade novel originally published in England as Murder Most Unladylike. Author Robin Stevens has published two more titles in the Wells & Wong mystery series, but we Americans are going to have to wait patiently for the American release of the second book.<br /><br />Daisy Wells and Hazel Wong are students at the English Deepdean School in the 1930s. They have decided to form a detective society, and as the story begins, their cases have been relatively unremarkable. However, when Hazel inadvertently stumbles across the body of a teacher in the gym, Daisy is excited about the prospect of an actual case. But when the body disappears, the girls know there is something sinister afoot. The teachers are all acting suspicious, and almost everyone has a motive. Are Daisy and Hazel getting involved with something larger than they can handle?<br /><br />Hazel serves as narrator, and she is the more insightful of the pair. Daisy is a clever girl, but she is very impulsive and so convinced that her deductions are correct that she dismisses any other possibilities. This causes a great deal of resentment on Hazel’s part, especially since she rarely confronts her friend. Daisy also seems to consider the entire affair to be a game; she forgets that real lives are at stake.<br /><br />Hazel also offers a unique perspective. British boarding schools were fairly homogenous in the 1930s. It wasn’t considered odd for boys to be sent away,<br />but a girl from Hong Kong is somewhat of a rarity. While the other girls are generally kind to Hazel, there is a general sense of casual racism, and on occasion, more overt slights. Hazel seems to bear this burden rather stoically. Hazel is extremely clever and astute, and although she is a stranger in astrange land, she manages to find friendship at school.<br /><br />This was an absolutely amazing book. I have always loved boarding school stories- especially British boarding school stories. Mysteries are another favorite of mine, so a combination of a jolly good boarding school story and a mystery? Just divine. If I had one complaint, it would be that the American version has changed some of the vocabulary. There are also explanations for some of the unchanged school terminology, and this was a bit of a distraction, considering that there is a glossary at the back of the book.<br /><br />I would absolutely recommend Murder is Bad Manners. This book is best suited for children in the later years of elementary school and older. This is a very fun book; although Daisy and Hazel are clearly the protagonists, there is a coterie of girls in the dorm who are also loyal friends. The mystery was satisfying, and I am eagerly awaiting the release of the next two books and the opportunity for Daisy and Hazel’s next two adventures!","2015-08-14","2015","Books"

In the first chapter a sweet little innocent boy is kidnapped and you don't know the outcome of what happened to the little book until the very end.<br /><br />This book is the third in a series of book so I agree with a earlier reviewer who said it is best to read the books in order.  I happened to find the second book at a thrift shop so I read that one first but I think I would have enjoyed the books more reading them in order.<br /><br />This book is the last in the series and I have only one criticism.  We are never informed if Dylan's stuggles with Peter Terry, the pasty demon are over.  In the bible demons are hurded into pigs and then the pigs are directed into water by Jesus.  I don't understand why Peter Terry could not be exorcised in some way so He wouldn't bother Dylan anymore.<br /><br />I do hope that this author continues to write more books.

I say unfortunately by no means because I think it unimportant, but rather because of the tenor of the debate with all sides picking one atonement theory as 'biblical' and attacking the rest. This might be most true of the penal-substitution camp, because they are most invested in their theory and so also have the most to lose.<br /><br />McKnight in 'A Community Called Atonement' carefully, clearly, and eruditely steers a path which while placing a heavy emphasis on penal-substitution, shows that the Atonement is bigger than any of our theories and so all of them have a place in explaining the deep mystery of God's atoning work.<br /><br />I appreciate the richness of the Atonement so much more after reading this book, and liked McKnight's focus on 'catching other people being right' instead of the usual 'find one area your opponent is wrong and drill that into the ground' approach one often sees.<br /><br />Also, I think his argument that the atonement is something to be lived in our relationship with God, others, and the world (rather than only believed) is quite a valuable insight.<br /><br />newwaystheology.[...]","2008-12-13","2008","Books"

It is mostly the reiteration of the previous book, which adds minor traits to the framework. It also repeats some ideas from \\""Networking with Millionaires\\"".    The framework by Thomas Stanley is a foundation of Robert Kyosaki's \\""Rich Dad\\"", John Cummuta's \\""Transforming debt into Weath\\"" and other financial intelligence books. John Cummuta have extended the ideas of Thomas Stanley by explaining the concept of compound interest, while Robert Kyosaki have resolved the issue of \\""live beyond your means\\"", advocated by Thomas J. Stanley. The drawback of Thomas Stanley is that he doesn't seem to suggest what do with accumulated wealth, and only advocates being prudent and frugal as a lifestyle, e.g. do not buy luxury cars or boats or wear expensive clothing's. Robert Kyosaki have criticized this modest lifestyle and have solved this drawback by clearly defined the distinctions of assets and the liabilities and suggested that luxury cars should be purchased from yields produced by the assets rather than from cash flows diverted from obtaining assets.    So, the \\""The Millionaire Mind\\"", although not a bad book, is a minor addition to \\""The Millionaire Next Door\\"", where the author have devised the terms \\""Under Accumulator of Wealth (UAW)\\"", \\""Average Accumulator of Wealth (AAW)\\"" and \\""Prodigious Accumulator of Wealth (PAW)\\"", and concluded that any American PAW household even with very modest income will become millionaire.     The main points of the framework are:  Spend Less Than You Earn, Avoid Buying Status Objects or Leading a Status Lifestyle, PAWs Are Willing to Take Financial Risk if it is Worth the Reward and Economic Outpatient Care. The authors also make the interesting observation that UAWs tend to have children who require an influx of their parents' money in order to afford the lifestyle that they expect for themselves, and that they are less likely to have been taught about money, budgeting and investingby their parents.    I would suggest \\""The Millionaire Next Door\\"" and \\""Networking with Millionaires\\"" in addition to this book, as well as the works by Robert Kyosaki and John Cummuta.","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

Decades of decadence backed by nothing more than IOUs, the destruction of the national cash reserves, and an economy that's poorly placed to turn itself around, all conspire to make this book's advice indispensable if you intend to protect your assets and survive the coming depression.<br /><br />For all the naysayers out there who think that Schiff's doom theory is unfounded, interestingly enough most of his work was written well before the current crisis. The subprime disaster has had a devastating effect on employment and 401Ks - just imagine what will happen when the credit card crunch arrives with hyper-inflation and nobody outside the US will keep lending us any money. It's going to hit the fan in a spectacular way, and this has a fundamental impact on your personal assets.","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

Her friend who wants to take it; hooks up with the overly gorgeous widower.  He learns of the necklace and of the cousin with the wealthy aunt.  He dumps the friend and heads to France to meet Precious.  They decide to get married and head to Venice where he leaves her at the alter after learning she will inherit nothing.  Precious tries to get on in life, is told a murderer is after her and in the end has to be saved by a the famous detective novel writer and her aunts.<br /><br />Overall the story was so weak I knew who was the murderer after the character was introduced.<br /><br />The novel writer was supposed to draw suspicion as to being the murderer or an accomplice especially after Precious learns of his wife's questionable suicide.  But I decided this was not so since he appeared so late in the story.<br /><br />Precious was supposed to be innocent but I found her annoying and a whiner.  I found her cousin Lilly more interesting.<br /><br />I wanted to like her crazy aunts but they were basically Auntie Mame.<br />\<br />I found the end to be rather lame.

This book puts Merrily and her daughter Jane in the middle of a maestrom that is fueled by an evangelist priest and a powerful wiccan.  It all takes place in a tiny little village right on the Welsh border where secrets have been kept for so long, they actually become part of the atmosphere.

In fact, my only criticism of the book is that it might be a little too scientific for the average reader. Still, one can skip some of those sections if he or she isn't interested. The sections on creating a food elimination diet are outstanding, with extensive lists of trouble foods, related foods, and substitutes. I particularly like that the author doesn't hype the treatment of food allergies as a miracle cure for everybody's problems and doesn't pimp any specific blood tests. This is rational, unsensational advice. It's not a cookbook, though; you'll have to go elsewhere for that. I did an elimination diet after reading this and have so far found that I am allergic to milk and soy. By avoiding those allergens, I have easily lost 20 lbs (and 2 inches off my waist), I have much more energy, my mood is significantly better, my knees don't continually ache anymore, my food cravings and constant hunger are gone, and my bladder issues have resolved. In short, I feel better than I have ever felt. Although not everyone will see results like this, I think anyone with nagging health problems should give the elimination diet a try, as it can't hurt, and the only real cost is having to cook just about every meal for a few weeks, which I consider a trivial cost compared to the gains I have seen.","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

By night he battles insomnia and depression. On his way to and from work each day, he notes the sad, soulless look everyone around him seems to have in their eyes. He wants to know how all the world seems to have fallen into this state of being and why does everyone seem fine with it? He comes up with the idea to put together a questionnaire, first testing it out on his co-workers by posing it as a required bit of paperwork &#34;coming down from corporate&#34;... a &#34;I'm just the messenger kind of thing&#34;, though as people start to fill these surveys out, he secretly reads the answers trying to find a common vein that would explain the outbreak of depression.<br /><br />This was a quiet, quirky little read. Nothing much in the way of tension or action occurs, but there is some thought-provoking and humorous social commentary to be had by readers who can relate to battling depression or struggling with a less than satisfying current reality when held up against youthful, rose-colored dreams. My favorite parts were the actual survey answers -- I thought they were pretty revealing in how people can get so caught up in being proper or politically correct that they forget what their own opinions or feelings really are. They actually convince themselves that sub-par is perfectly fine and eventually stop striving for anything better than the &#34;getting by&#34; level. Everyone forgets or fears actually being honest with themselves.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the survey Q&A bits, and a few humorous moments here and there, much of the rest of the book -- if I'm being completely honest here -- bored me a bit. And ugh, I really did not like Raymond's wife, Brenda. She was a special kind of bitter. There was a bit of a twist at the end but it left me a little confused and wondering well, if you're going to go that route, what was the point of the rest of the story?! I could see this kind of story making an interesting film, in the vein of something like Punch Drunk Love or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.ee this kind of story making an interesting film, in the vein of something like Punch Drunk Love or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.","2015-08-14","2015","Books"

Third Man is indeed inferior to the film, which Graham all but concedes upfront, introducing it as a workmanlike story written as a sketch for the movie. You just can't get Orson Welles' screen magnetism, Reed's elegant canted angles or the kickass zither from the page, and the movie's ending is just worlds better. But a good read nonetheless.<br /><br />Fallen Idol is the real gem here. So lean and vivid. I love the feverish child-logic that drives it. Certain leaps and passages are a bit WTF? till you remember the driving consciousness is that of a 7 year old. Both stories hinge in different ways on children & disrupted innocence (with the image that fixes Lime's nefariousness in Rollo's mind in 3rd Man and the whole structure of Fallen Idol), which gives a smart thematic thrust to their collection together.<br /><br />Ian Thomson's foreword [in the UK Random House edition, though possibly not in this item] is quite good too, calling the above disrupted innocence motif \\""an awareness of sin and human wretchedness that can be termed 'Catholic.'\\"" It's everything an intro to a short little volume should be, chatty and stage-setting but deftly incisive: \\""Frontiers have a dynamism of their own in Greene's fiction: they set off a reflex of unease.\\"" Indeed.","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

Literally, it changed the way I think, and the way I see the world.  In Evolution 2.0, I believe Perry Marshall has created what will be seen as a masterpiece of popular science writing. Not only because it is staggeringly thorough and well-written, but because it turns the whole game board upside down, scattering the pieces in the old Creation vs. Evolution debate.  Perry Marshall sets out his series arguments (centering on the key observation that DNA appears in every important respect to be a code) in painstaking detail, yet the reader is never fatigued, because between every line of this book you can glimpse the immensely important meta-question... &#34;If DNA is a code, and it is, and if every code is designed, where's the designer?&#34;  Like a true scientist (or mystic), Perry does a great job of sticking to the facts, with a nod to the staggeringly momentous implications of the question, through his personal stories that are interwoven throughout the narrative.  You - the reader - are left with the responsibility, and the opportunity, of looking at this Universe, and your place in it, in a whole new light.  I can say with confidence that I am going to recommend this book to every thinking person I know.  (I should also mention that a consortium is offering a multi-million dollar technology prize to anyone who can prove the fact of any naturally-occurring code!)","2015-08-14","2015","Books"

She mixes genres and includes multiple narratives.  Her finished product is a written collage held together by a strong theme--a found connection between the adventurous spirit of those in her book and herself.    Wilke uses diverse genres to construct her piece.  Her first form is family history.  This allows her to tell the story of her Grandmother Marie and her sister Laura's road trip from their Iowa farm to the west coast with six other women, thus the name.  Sources for this narrative are based on Wilke's interviews with some of the eight women. But this effort was lacking since the women were in their eighties and nineties and had forgotten many facts and details.  Better sources were their journal accounts, their letters written back home to family, and photos which Wilke includes to fill out the story.    Wilke's second genre is memoir.  Here she tells the story of her  childhood summertime visits to Grandma Marie and Aunt Laura in Iowa, and her adult life in Montana.  Her memories include family myths shared during visits with Grandma Marie and Aunt Laura while they did the daily routines on the farm.  The narrative then extends beyond Wilke's childhood and draws on her Montana experiences with her husband where she traces some of the same territory Marie and Laura covered on their trip west.  Like all memoir the writer plays many roles: storyteller, protagonist, and philosopher.    The summary at the end of the book gives insight into the writer's process:  \\""Our lives weave together like pounding river water.  I try to write about my grandmother only, but the connections are too strong.  My own stories slip in, along with those of her sister, her mother, and my mother.  I can't tease one free, or write about one of us without another.  Memories, stories, people, and seasons dissolve, and I am surrounded by water.  I stand on a point of dry land while thefuture boils past me, past Iowa, to where other women pull other children to safety, toward life.\\"" (pp. 167, 168)    Wilke's collage collects life experience flowing from one generation into another.  The past is the future, the present is the past.  Sometimes text flows easily, but other times the reader is left confused.  Like all memoir, the writer attempts to make sense of memory, hers and her families.  Wilke's effort, though at times clumsy, often sparkles.  She makes a solid connection between her life and the lives of her ancestors.","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

The stories were more evolved, the characters more fleshed out, and I found myself longing to read more about them. The stories drew me in and kept me reading, wondering where each couple would end up.    While all the stories were well written, three had me completely unable to put the book down until the very last page.     \\""Six Weeks on Sunrise Mountain, Colorado\\"" by Gwen Masters    \\""Baby, It's Cold Outside\\"" by Marilyn Jaye Lewis    \\""Sweet Season\\"" by Shanna Germain    I think that the stories were outstanding, but a little light on the hot sex we've come to expect from  RKB anthologies. If you're looking for something hardcore, fast and furious, then this might not be the book for you. While the sex is there, the writing seems to be centered around the couples and their relationship, not the sex itself.

It is quite stunning.  The book chronicles the emerging views of a group of students in school in Los Angeles who are taught by a new teacher.  This teacher has fresh ideas and strong principles that she lives up to.  She always goes the extra mile for the kids, getting extra part time jobs to buy them books, take them on educational trips etc.  More than tha,t she manages to relate the tensions and tragedies of their lives to others in literature, the story of Anne Franc, for instance.  This has a transforming effect on the kids who become freedom writers as a result (a pun on the freedom riders who broke segregation in the south).  It is totally inspiring, though also deeply critical of much of US society and its education system.   Obama will need a whole generation of freedom writers but this book gives some idea of how to produce them.  Yes they can!","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

As the interrogations unfold, you get to feel the full range of emotions experienced by the terrorist, and then see how they are used by a new breed of interrogator.  These interrogators use their brains, rather than force, to 'break' one terrorist after another, leading them to the most wanted man in Iraq.                The book has left me with a better sense of how complex the situation is in Iraq, and also a deeper understanding of what it means to be human...and why some people do inhuman things.  In the face of these inhuman things, I deeply admire the courage of the author to maintain his moral compass and lead change.

Burke did what no other writer had done in establishing a framework and a moral philosophy for conservative thought.    Burke deplored the reckless upheaval he saw in France, in which so much good was lost in a cataclysmic uprising, simply because it was traditional good. While not afraid of change, especially necessary change, Burke compellingly advocates caution and respect for tradition, so that political changes are more likely to be for the best.    Most importantly, Burke is almost single-handedly responsible for all modern conservative movements; while not all who call themselves conservative recognize Burke's centrality, all true conservatives see his work as foundational.    I could go on and on about this book, but thankfully thousands of other writers have done so already. For all these readings, this is required reading for anyone who wishes to play a meaningful role in society, whether liberal or conservative. A timeless classic.","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

Its style is  experiential, at times employing stream-of-consciousness techniques.     Both of the two novels currently available in English (part three is due in 2009) are centered around a single event; in this case a visit to a night club. Marias cleverly uses flashbacks and foreshadowing to weave together the various levels of narrative. Marias fans will also recognise strands from earlier books, although it can be appreciated without any further reading (however it is recommended to read part one).    Jacques Deza, a Spaniard living in London, is gifted with the most incredible powers of observation which he puts to use working for an unnamed fraction of the English secret service. As time goes by, he begins to realise the impact of his analyses on the lives of others, which culminates in a choice between life and death in the night club scene.    In short, this is a highly eclectic combination of genres and styles - imagine Proust writing an existentialist spy novel in the 21st century. Javier's epic sentences can drag on for pages, but they are so incredibly precise that no word is ever superfluous. If you shy away from lengthy sentences, start with one of his earlier books - [[ASIN:0811214532 All Souls]] is recommended. Otherwise, give it some time and you will find yourself churning through this book - his most mature and ambitious to date.","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

All her life, she has used that to manipulate and occasionally even deceive. It's the only way she knows--but when Mitch Dennehy insists desire isn't enough, Charity has to devise a new plan. She's loved Mitch ever since she broke up him and her sister. But does she love him enough to turn to his God?<br /><br />Mitch is determined to steer clear of Charity, and not just because her deceptive wiles seduced him into a situation that ended his engagement. He can't trust her, and what's more, he can't trust himself around her. But when she begins seeing Rigan Gallagher, Mitch has to step in. Gallagher has already ruined one woman in Mitch's life--he isn't going to stand by while he ruins another.<br /><br />From Dublin to Boston and back again, A Passion Redeemed sweeps us away into an era gone by with amazing characters that speak to our hearts today. I absolutely love it when an author takes a character I wouldn't normally like and pulls me so deep into her heart and mind that I can't help but root for her. That's exactly what Lessman does with Charity O'Connor. The bad girl in the first book in the series, A Passion Most Pure, Charity was not high on my list of \\""characters to like.\\"" But in this book we see a side of her never developed in the first, one that shows her kind heart and deep love. Through Charity's eyes, her treatment of her sister and father is perfectly understandable and as her story unfolds I came to first comprehend, then pity, and finally love this girl too beautiful for her own good.<br /><br />I fully expected this to be yet another treatment of passion that at once presented its reality and the need for a higher passion for the Lord. I wasn't disappointed. Though a very different story from the first book in the Daughters of Boston Series, and one fully capable of being read apart from it, A Passion Redeemed delves deep into the dangers of seduction and the wages for that particular sin.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book enough! It will challenge your heart, fill your mind, and make you take a look at the depth of your own faith. You're not going to want to put this one down--and trust me, you shouldn't!

While there were many new revelations based on genetic research, the overall effect was confusion rather than clarity. Perhaps I should blame myself for my lack of knowledge of genetics, but my understanding was that his book was intended for the lay reader, and I did not find that to be true in some of the more complex sections. Also, the chapter entitled &#34;History,&#34; which concerned itself with the genetics of several groups such as Icelanders, Jews, et al, while interesting, and acceptably relevant to the book's stated purpose, the section on whether or not Thomas Jefferson fathered Sally Hemmings' children came totally out of left field, and had no place in this book.

In this book the author(s) (I'm not quite sure who did what here as there are several co-authors listed in the acknowledgments who aren't listed on the cover) review what they consider to be the greatest failures of certain--not all--of the presidents from Washington to George W. Bush. (Interestingly, Bush the Father doesn't have a chapter but was included in the Iran-Contra chapter). There are no footnotes and no bibliography, only \\""additional reading\\"" for each chapter, which, I assume, comprised their source material unless these authors knew it all of the top of their heads.    Of course, anything of this sort will be extremely subjective, but, in this case, I was at a loss to determine the authors' method of choice. In the introduction it is noted that the Monica Lewinsky scandal and Clinton's impeachment are not included because the co-authors \\""...could not agree definitively that the ...scandals...actually inflicted damage on the United States at the time.\\"" In fact, there is no chapter on Clinton, implying, I suppose, that he had no major failures. However, (and I'm a Democrat), if Carter's botched attempt at rescuing the Iranian hostages was included, why not the Battle of Mogadishu (Black Hawk Down)?    There are also some inclusions I question. For example, what has become known as \\""The Trail of Tears,\\"" the relocation of the Cherokee under Andrew Jackson. A qualifier here. I am a huge advocate for American Indian rights and know more about America's treatment of the Indians than most professional historians. However, I can't say I see how it falls under the rubric noted above re: the absence of the Lewinsky scandal. While it was certainly a moral shame, I don't see how it could be seen as \\""inflicting damage on the US at the time.\\"" More significant would be the taking of the Black Hills in the 1870s leading to a rallying of Plains Indian Tribes and Custer's defeat at The Little Bighorn.    I would also question the inclusion of the Energy Crisis under Jimmy Carter as a presidential failure. Too bad if it caused some economic woes at the time. In retrospect we'd have done better to stick with gas rationing and lowering our thermostats.    I did appreciate the inclusion of Iran-Contra, the now all but forgotten illegal dealings of the Reagan administration which are far too complicated to outline here. At a time when both Republicans and Democrats feel the need to pay lip service to the late president, it's good to remember what that administration got away with and how it began the line of thinking that the president is above the law and all things are allowable as commander-in-chief. However, I would have liked to see other inclusions under Reagan, like the firing of the Air Traffic Controllers and the banking deregulation that led to the Keating scandal (of which John McCain was a part).    Then again, you can't include everything or it would be a tome. All-in-all a good read, especially for those who avoid history because they think it is too boring. This is an easy read, covers a lot of important history, and, at its best, may entice people to read more about these events.","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

Hundreds and hundreds of phrases with their English translations, but this book has a fatal flaw that is common to early Hawaiian language publications. This book neglects two essential elements of the Hawaiian language, the 'okina and kahako.<br /><br />The 'okina is a consonant in the Hawaiian language. It represents what is known as a glottal stop and is correctly depicted as an upside down apostrophe. It is often stated that the Hawaiian language has 12 letters, but that is incorrect. There are 13 letters; a, e, i, o, u, h, k, l, m, n, p, w and the 'okina. The 'okina is sporadically used in this book and on the rare occasion it is shown, it is depicted as an apostrophe, not an upside down apostrophe.<br /><br />The kahako goes missing altogether in this book. The kahako known in English as a macron is a diacritic mark that indicates that a vowel is a long vowel. The kahako is depicted as a straight line over a vowel.<br /><br />Because the 'okina and kahako were excluded for many years or decades and even today they are often omitted; many people believe that both symbols are inauthentic and illegitimate characters, when nothing could be further from the truth. There might also be a fallacious belief that they are optional characters. The 'okina and kahako give a more accurate written representation of the spoken Hawaiian language and they should be regarded as being as essential as any other letter.<br /><br />The spelling of many Hawaiian words in this book are incomplete and incorrect. This book should be revised and edited so that the 'okina and kahako are include in the spelling of the words that have them. Using this book is awfully troublesome, for one must realize what is missing and make the revision in their mind. It might be like reading a book in English where a couple letters, say the \\""s\\"" the \\""r\\"", are never used and maybe the letters \\""t\\"" and \\""p\\"" are shown only half of the time. You might be able to understand what is being written, but it sure would make for challenging reading and I don't think any English language instructor would be tolerant of such omissions. I do not recommend this book, nor should anyone even glance at this book if they do not have a vast and solid grasp of Hawaiian vocabulary and grammar.<br /><br />I wish I could recommend a book that is similar, but much better than the \\""Hawaiian Phrase Book\\"", but I don't know of any.

While the basic premise of the book is very good (to describe these ailments in terms that are accessible to a large population) and is also highly altruistic as it attempts to advocate for the needs of special needs children - many of which are often overlooked by the very people who are supposed to help, there are also a few problems.    Overall, the book accomplishes its mission to identify and report on a large number of disorders. The problem is that there are simply too many to discuss and, indeed, not enough attention is given to adequately describe many of the most common ones. For example, the discussion on Attention Deficit Disorder and all of its various manifestations (i.e., hyperactivity [ADHD], without hyperactivity [ADD], etc.) is too simplistic and does not accurately describe the disorder. What is provided is, arguable, the most commonly associated symptoms for some types of ADD/ADHD but, in doing so, also fails to provide adequate information that would accurately describe many who have the disorder. Viable alternative treatments, particularly neurofeedback, are also ignored.    Another problem with the book is that some other, rather significant disorders are never mentioned at all. One such disorder is Developmental Apraxia of Speech, a rather perplexing problem in which normal language development is delayed and causes significant difficulties for children who have are afflicted.    Overall, Alphabet Kids is a good reference but should never be considered as the definitive sources. A little knowledge can be dangerous and, should this book be used in isolation, it may fail to accomplish its goal.","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

A Faith And Culture Devotional: Daily Readings on Art, Science, and Life, compiled by Veritas Forum founder Kelly Monroe Kullberg and author and educator Lael Arrington, doesn't follow the usual time-honored devotional formula of Bible verse(s), brief inspiring story and/or application, prayer for the day. In fact, I'm not quite sure \\""devotional\\"" is the right category for this wonderful book. It is a digest of provocative bite-sized essays from respected Christian voices from across our culture's spectrum. Bible and Theology, History, Philosophy, Science, Literature, Arts and Contemporary Culture are each represented in the 15 weeks of daily readings. Contributors include Frederica Matthewes-Green, R.C. Sproul, J.P. Moreland, John Eldredge, Francis Collins, Philip Yancey, and Terry Glaspey. Though all are orthodox in their basic theology, they are not all from the same theological or ideological camp.<br /><br />That's the strength of this volume. Though there are devotional elements to it, this volume is more about allowing ourselves to enter into interior dialogue with important ideas. It is intended to help readers live faithfully as learners, and seamlessly weave what we're learning into the whole cloth of our lives.<br /><br />Each day's 500-800 word essay is followed by a set of reflection/discussion questions designed to take the day's reading and make it sticky. For instance, on day seven of week one's readings, the day of the week devoted to contemporary culture issues, Erwin McManus writes about a discussion he had with a group of Muslims about Christianity. In summarizing his surprising conversation with the group, he says, \\""Religion exists not because God loves too little but because we need love so much.\\"" The three reflection and discussion questions following his essay are the kind of great, open-ended asks that invite probing thought.<br /><br />Recommended.

It's pretty unbelievable how many important decisions were committed to the discretion of one or a few people back in that time. I think the careful reader will see that this was a double-edged sword: outcomes came faster, but serious mistakes could also happen without a protracted process where the advantages and disadvantages of each decision were weighed carefully. Although Mr. Marshall would of course be displeased by our burdensome notice-and-comment process in administrative law today, it is worth considering the benefits of carefully considered administrative decisions.

Best chapters: SBC's and LI.","The book provides a good general overview of VoIP security, covering multiple topics involved on securing a VoIP infrastructure, from network devices to VoIP servers, plus secure VoIP protocols. In my opinion, the best chapters are chapter 8 and 10 & 11, Session Border Controllers (SBC's) and Lawful Interception (LI), respectively; it is difficult to find books covering these topics still today, although these are two of the major areas regarding VoIP security nowadays.    SBC's are the VoIP security element by design and therefore a key device in any VoIP infrastructure. The book covers SBC's types, access and peering, expected SBC functionality and capabilities (such as DoS protection, translation and NAT features, LI, high availability and load balancing, etc) and offers a brief introduction to its architecture design concepts.    Lawful Interception (LI) by law enforcement (LE), or LI by LE :), is one of the main VoIP research topics today, especially when strong security features are added, such as signaling and media encryption, that difficult the interception tasks. The last two chapters cover the fundamentals of LI on VoIP networks (following the Cisco model, as there are three other standards), describing the different elements, fucntions, and interfaces involved. It is a theoretical chapter followed by some practical advice to implement LI, very detailed and Cisco-based.    The book starts with an introductory overview of VoIP, its benefits and drawbacks, and some security concerns. Then it provides another VoIP threat taxonomy, a good generic overview that lacks some VoIP threats and complements (or simply provides another perspective to) the IETF draft and VOIPSA VoIP threat taxonomies. Unfortunately, I have not found yet a classification that consolidates all the different VoIP threats from (IMHO) the right perspective.    Chapter 3 offers an interesting summarized analysis of the main VoIP protocols, how they work, and their main security requirementsand features. It covers H.323, SIP, and MGCP; I specially liked the SIP section, with descriptive message captures and flow diagrams. Chapter 5 complements the VoIP protocols with the main network devices in a VoIP environment, their role, and key security requirements. Although chapter 7 extends the security analysis of VoIP protocols, covering authentication and signaling and media encryption, it does not cover the latest key exchange solutions, such as DTLS, ZRTP or MickeyV2, as it is focused mainly on S/MIME.    All these chapters provide a lightweight analysis of VoIP security, not going very much in-depth into any of the topics covered. The book is a good overview reference for the VoIP security novice reader, I guess intended for network and system administrators, law enforcement, or security pros new to VoIP.    VoIP threats, including some attack types and tools, are analyzed on chapter 6. This chapter covers in detail a few VoIP attacks, providing simulation, examples and command line options for widely available attack tools. It allows the reader to see some real attacks in action, although it only shows the tip of the iceberg regarding all the tools and attacks that are possible; please, do not get the feeling that this is all you can do.    Chapter 4 covers cryptography, and in my opinion, it doesn't fit on the book; although crypto is a key aspect to protect VoIP infrastructures, the novice reader can get this info from other sources.    As the book is from Cisco Press, chapter 9 focuses on specific Cisco features and syntax, specially for practical sections that provide configuration details for firewalls, access devices, and the Unified Communication Manager (& Express), formerly CallManager. The info is useful to get an overview of the implementation steps, but do not apply to you if you are using equipment from other vendors.    Overall, it is a generic reference book to start getting involved into the VoIP security world, acquire a general understanding of the main VoIP security threats, target network elements, VoIP protocols, and security solutions. Once again, the SBC and LI sections are my favorites.","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

The period studied is from the Shang to the Han (roughly 1766 BCE to 220 CE).<br /><br />\\""The Meaning of China's Most Ancient Art\\"" is richly illustrated, not only with photos and drawings of the Gansu pottery shards being studied, but also with ancient and modern Chinese characters, linking the designs' cosmological and mythical origins linguistically to the Chinese language. Younger readers will need a Wade-Giles/Pinyin chart as all transliterations into English use the older Wade-Giles system, but the inclusion of ancient ideographs and their evolution into today's Chinese characters makes this work especially fascinating. Many of the interpretations expressed in this work are still controversial, but wherever possible, Bulling includes references to ancient texts to help support his hypotheses (and, when relevant, examples from other ancient cultures).

All the chemicals did was change his colors, but he got a little brain damaged from holding his breath while contemplating whether he should just let himself drown or escape. Also in Batman Confidential, we learn how the Joker got his smile. This version is backed-up by Batman RIP when the Joker has to get the sides of his mouth re-stitched. We also delve into the Joker's true reason for causing havok in gotham.    Okey, what I really like most about Batman Confidential was that it did away with the campiness & the plotholes. The Red Hood was so cheesy & questionable that the author threw it out the window, having a wife made him too humane, so he was made a nomadic bachelor with a questionable line of work, the nerve-ending issue had to go because the Joker was capable of frowning, so they had Batman slit his mouth with a batterang to make it wider.    While I was a bit taken aback by the Aeon Flux style art at first, this has become one of the most cherished pieces of my Joker collection.    If I was to pick one Batman novel that this hugely contradicted, it would be the easily forgotten Batman: Secrets, in the way that Batman Confidential & Gotham Knights tent to contradict eachother.","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

The book is littered with grammar mistakes, typographical errors, and odd locutions.  The way the text is organized, they end up covering the same subjects from multiple angles, with the result that they repeat themselves over and over.  Sometimes the organization simply seems haphazard, with \\""notes\\"" appearing at the end of a section which could be more accurately labeled \\""afterthoughts.\\""  The information presented is clear and accurate; just don't expect a gripping read.<br /><br />This book is definitely a useful addition for any other meathead out there wanting to try and make fermented sausages at home.  As a book dedicated to this subject, they go deeper into the issues of chemistry, microbiology, sanitation, and equipment (for smoking, fermenting, and drying) that all affect the quality of the finished product.  The second part contains 50 detailed recipes, with precise measurements in grams, so that even a relative newcomer to this craft can proceed with confidence.  This book usefully bridges the gap between simpler cookbooks and advanced textbooks such as Fidel Toldr&aacute;'s [[ASIN:0813814774 Handbook of Fermented Meat and Poultry]] (which sells for $200).  At $20, even with all its faults on its head, this book is a bargain.<br /><br />To read my full review, go to my website.<br /><br />Update, 7/8/09: Just heard from Stanley Marianski that they have revised this book and it's coming out from a new publisher (Bookmagic).  If you decide to buy, this is the edition you want-it has an index!","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

Part space opera, part cop procedural, the book focuses on Tom Dreyfus, a senior officer for Panoply, the organization charged with the security of the Glitter Band, an orbital ring of habitats surrounding the planet Yellowstone in the Epsilon Eridani system. Because the novel's events occur about a century before the Melding Plague that effectively destroyed the civilization around Yellowstone, we get to see a tantalizing glimpse of the golden era before the plague struck.<br /><br />After the deliberate destruction of one of the Glitter Band's ten thousand habitats, apparently by the transhuman Ultras, Dreyfus is tasked to investigate the crime. What he discovers goes far beyond the murder of a thousand people, leading eventually to a danger threatening the entire Glitter Band.<br /><br />Dreyfus battles Aurora, an AI that wants to rule the Glitter Band, as well as a highly-placed traitor within Panoply. Reynolds throws in another complication in the form of the Clockmaker, another ruthless AI that Panoply had thought destroyed nine years before the story opens. Before long, it becomes clear that the Clockmaker may still be a threat, and that Dreyfus has some really big problems to solve.<br /><br />The book is a standalone, and you do not have to have read the previous novels to enjoy or understand what's happening. I especially enjoyed seeing the Yellowstone civilization at its height, rather than the sad remnants depicted in the previous books. More of that, please.<br /><br />Enjoyable and taut to the very last page, The Prefect is a winner. Highly recommended.","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

The first section was straight gangbusters, with the explanation of American strategy as being calculated to avoid the very real possibilities of a \\""garrison state\\"", \\""tributary state\\"" or \\""castle society.\\"" \\""The purpose of the American way of strategy is to defend the American way of life by means that do not endanger the American way of life.\\"" Right on.<br /><br />Lind's summary of early US foreign policy is very good, his WWI, interwar & WWII is pretty good, and his Cold War is excellent, but after that the book falls apart in a hurry. The closer he gets to the present day, the more antique it all seems. All about unitary states, not a non-state actor to be found, and all the concern is with forging anti-hegemonic networks of power to prevent rising great states from dominating the globe (really, if there is a Russia-China-US alliance, who are we balancing?). The book seems to take place on a Risk board; It just didn't seem to grapple with the really sticky issues of today. And the chapter on economic globalisation was exceedingly weak. Seriously, skip that part.<br /><br />Lind is very very fluent at Realism, but much shakier at holding up the Liberal Internationalism side of his thesis, I feel. Now, Liberal Internationalism often gets smeared as inherently wobbly, so Lind's added handicap doesn't help the case. But some of his prescriptions are just flagrantly DOA. A world where the US will forge separate alliances with all major powers in all areas, elevate Russia and China to the relative detriment of Japanese and German security-clients, shrug at Taiwan and So Korea being retaken, nationalize & protect the bejeesus out of all defense-related industry and act as the materiel supplier while other nations somehow eagerly provide all the boots on the ground? ...Really? There's surely something to be said for thinking outside the box, but in terms of real political plausibility, I'm not sure Lind really knows where the box is.<br /><br />All in all I liked the first third and the last chapter, everything else was not so great. You can do much better for a Realism / Liberal Internationalism hybrid by reading Steve Walt and Anne-Marie Slaughter back-to-back & calling it a day.n terms of real political plausibility, I'm not sure Lind really knows where the box is.

The times and his life were nothing if not complicated.      1492 is the same year that Isabella and Ferdinand completed the long Reconquista of Spain in Granada, which is itself quite a tale, clearly full of its own intrigues and the march up to the Alhambra. How she found time to understand, approve, and bankroll Columbus would be very interesting to know.

In this case the scene is Vienna, on the eve of the Great War. I was captivated.<br /><br />And what a cast of characters! Russian revolutionaries (Stalin, Lenin, Trotsky), aristocrats and courtiers of the Habsburg dynasty (foremost among them the Emperor Franz Joseph and the Crown Prince, Franz Ferdinand); future catalyst of WWII, Adolf Hitler; and a host of intellectual and artistic giants such as Sigmund Freud, Thomas Mann, Oskar Kokoschka, and Arnold Sch&ouml;nberg. Impressively, the main narrative thread isn't lost in this colorful swirl of personages; in fact, for a reader with even a modest grounding in European history and culture, these numerous fleeting appearances only add to the vibrancy of the tale.<br /><br />I was swept up immediately by Morton's heady prose -- at times, I confess, I found it to dip rather heavily into the symbolic or engage in the overly rhetorical flourish -- but still his writing has undeniable evocative power. Here, for instance, is a passage describing the eccentric habit of a struggling artist living in poverty in a Viennese \\""men's home\\"":<br /><br />\\""....Now the brush would drop from his hand. He would push the palette aside. He would rise to his feet.<br />  \\""He began to speak, to shout, to orate. With hissing consonants and hall-filling vowels, he launched into a harangue on morality, racial purity, the German mission and Slav treachery, on Jews, Jesuits, and Freemasons. His forelock would toss, his color-stained hands shred the air, his voice rise to an operatic pitch. Then, just as suddenly as he had started, he would stop. He would gather his things together with an imperious clatter, stalk off to his cubicle.<br />  \\""And the others would just stare after him.\\""<br /><br />That, of course, was a sketch of Adolf Hitler.<br /><br />But what most struck me after reading A Distant Thunder is how well Morton had made clear the causes of World War I. Of course, every school boy knows that the trigger was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Like me, however, many have undoubtedly wondered just who was this Franz Ferdinand to have set off such a sequence of cataclysmic events. Morton makes the ill-fated Crown Prince the central character of his book, and in doing so infuses it with heavy irony, for Franz Ferdinand was, despite all his bluster, a constant advocate of peace, not war. That the Great War was begun ostensibly on his account was the supreme irony.<br /><br />Morton adroitly renders a sympathetic but unsentimental portrait of Franz Ferdinand, highlighting his problematic relationship with his uncle, the Emperor, and his devotion to his wife Sophie, whom he had married contrary to Habsburg wishes. If there is a tragedy here beyond the insane march to war, it is this story of a prince and the sacrifices he made for his beloved wife, who was continually slighted by a court intent on keeping her down among the \\""non-royals\\"" in its merciless pecking order.<br /><br />Finally, as an occasional visitor to Vienna, a city I've long admired, I'm greatly looking forward to reading Morton's other Vienna-inspired history, A Nervous Splendor, which deals with the suicide of Crown Prince Rudolf in 1889.But what most struck me after reading A Distant Thunder is how well Morton had made clear the causes of World War I.

Eric Cline is an ancient historian and an archaeologist, and he attempts to unravel seven mysteries of the Hebrew Bible. While it would be a mistake to call Cline a biblical minimalist, he does seem to value secular and archaeological data more than the data found within the Hebrew text itself, a predilection that will color some of his conclusions.<br /><br />He concludes that 1) If the Garden of Eden exists, it is probably in the southern Mesopotamian area, and perhaps at the bottom of the Persian Gulf. 2) He stresses that the Noah's ark story is a Hebrew rewrite of ancient legendary flood stories from other cultures and that the ark is probably lost forever if it ever existed, and that we should be spending an equal amount of energy searching for the arks mentioned in other Ancient Near Eastern legends as well.3) He discusses the stories of Sodom and Gomorrah and concludes they are either lost somewhere under the Dead Sea, or that they existed along the Dead Sea and need to be further excavated. 4) He contends that the Exodus story could not have happened as the Bible portrays it because of its logistical improbabilities (2.5 million people marching through the desert for 40 years would not only be unlikely, they would have left some archaeological remains behind for us to examine). 5) While we do have some evidence of Israel in the land of Canaan as early as 1207 BC and there is some evidence that two of the Canaanite cities were overthrown and taken over by the Israelites, they were probably overthrown by the Sea Peoples, and the Israelites merely took advantage and occupied these towns. 6) The ark of the covenant was probably destroyed by King Nebuchadnezzar in 586 BC, but if it still exists, it's probably buried under the Temple Mount. 7) The ten lost tribes of Israel were never really lost, because the kings of Asyria and Babylon only deported about 10-20% of the people. Others were moved in rom the surrounding areas, and when they intermarried with the Israelites, they formed what we now know as the Samaritan people.<br /><br />Cline is inclined to question the historicity of any Bible story that doesn't have corresponding evidence in the archaeological or historical records. This means that he is invariably more pessimistic about the Hebrew Bible's historicity up to the time of David than he is about the material after the time of David (though he has questions about some of this as well).<br /><br />I am much more optimistic about the historicity of what we have in the Hebrew Bible narratives, and I must also say that Cline is not a biblical theologian/historian per se. But he writes well and he engages the reader throughout. He has discussions in every chapter about modern amateur archaeologists who have made unverifiable claims that they have solved and discovered some of these mysteries. He casually dismisses these claims, but he applauds their zeal. At the same time, he contends that we should only trust research performed by trained and reputable archaeologists and trained historians.<br /><br />This is a very interesting book, and it should probably be read in conjunction with a book like the one edited by a reputable biblical historian, Daniel Block: \\""Israel: Ancient Kingdom or late Invention.\\""deported about 10-20% of the people.

I was a supporter of President Ford who sweated out the possibility of an incumbent president being rejected by his own party even though Ford was a decent president who stood a much better chance at defeating Jimmy Carter in the November elections.    Although Craig Shirley obviously was a Reagan admirer -- maybe even a Reagan worshiper -- he did an excellent job in keeping this story as fair and balanced as possible.  President Ford, as the incumbent, certainly had many advantages as the establishment within the Republican Party rallied around him.  Although he had not previously been nominated or elected to the presidency, he had governed as a Republican since succeeding President Nixon and his failure to claim the nomination would have been an embarrassment to the GOP.  The party's infrastructure was dedicated to saving President Ford.  But Shirly also points out that there were many problems facing the Ford campaign.  Both campaigns had strengths and weaknesses and Shirley did an excellent job pointing them out.  This book was not written to be a hatchet job on either the Republican Party that nominated Gerald Ford over Ronald Reagan or on President Ford himself.  The book was more of a historical look at the epic campaign for the 1976 GOP nomination told by an unbiased Reagan supporter.  This lack of bias is what makes this an excellent book.    I remembered well much of what Shirley described in the book.  What struck me the most is the North Carolina primary.  I remember that night listening on the radio and an announcement came over about an upset.  Being a Ford supporter and one who despised Jimmy Carter at the time my first thought was that George Wallace's faltering campaign may have shown some life and sprung an upset that would derail Carter's campaign.  After a commercial break, however, I heard the upset was not what I had hoped.  That primary upset for Reagan maybe redirected US politics for the next few decades.  HadPresident Ford won he probably could have cruised to the nomination and Reagan would have been forced out.  With a unified party behind him, Ford may have won the election and Reagan would have been just a footnote in history.    I personally do not think for a moment that Ronald Reagan would have won the 1976 election had he won the nomination.  The GOP would have been split in a manner comparable to what happened in 1964 even though Reagan was a much more persuasive and smoother campaigner than Barry Goldwater.  Reagan would have ran better than Ford in some areas of the country but not as well as Ford in other areas of the country.  Although Reagan was undoubtably a better communicator and campaigner than President Ford, his campaign organization was lacking and his message was seen as still too far to the right so as to scare off many potential voters.  That was still an issue in 1980 but after four years of President Carter's ineptness and the country being slapped around in the international arena I think the American people were willing to roll the dice and take a chance with Ronald Reagan.  Reagan's victory in 1980, in my opinion, was more of a rejection of Jimmy Carter than it was of acceptance of Ronald Reagan.  However, the 1984 was definitely acceptance of Reagan.    Mr. Shirley is to be commended for this excellent account of the 1976 campaign for the GOP nomination.  He set aside his self-admitted biases and gave the reader a book that was informative and enjoyable regardless of who one supported during the 1976 campaign.    As for the Republican Party, I am personally tired of candidates trying to be the next Ronald Reagan.  I told co-workers last year that I did not want another Reagan.  I want candidates to step up and be their own self.  Reagan was true to himself -- although his governance was more moderate than his rhetoric -- and I wanted a candidate who would be true to themself.  Instead of adopting a \\""What would Reagan do?\\"" attitude towardstoday's issues the GOP need candidates who will think for themselves.  What would Reagan do?  Probably tell them to think for themselves.","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

The 1947 version with a lengthy review by Marquis W. Childs, apparently a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist originally from Clinton, IA (1903 - 1990), is highly informative concerning the life and views of Brooks Adams. The book itself leaves a bit to be desired - but where else can one find a summary list of sugar prices round the world over 19th century decades? Childs notes the popularity of Adams in Europe but not in the States; the combative nature of Brooks to argue for the sake of argument, which sorely tired brother Henry; Brooks suspicion of excessive competition (recall his period, post robber barons) with need for proper government regulation (if only he could visit the 21st century); his belief that exaltation of the profit motive above all else debased American life and values. Both Brooks and Henry came to believe that by its nature and substance, \\""American democracy\\"" was almost foreordained to degradation and decay, closely related to workings of economic cycles (they survived the 1893 Panic), particularly affected by inventions and technology far outpacing humanity's ability to grasp their implications. This development, population density, plus a form of centralized commercial and administrative organization Brooks saw as responsible for shifts in social equilibrium (organization not by government, which Brooks considered a disastrous failure after George Washington, but especially with the election of Jackson over his grandfather John Quincy), often resulting in war and new rising powers. Which is what this book is mostly about: America's reluctant rise over that of a declining, late 1800s United Kingdom. Before his death at age 79 in 1927, writes Childs, \\""Brooks, the agnostic, doubter and profound skeptic returned to his Puritan roots and his church, overcoming his lifelong shyness, where he stood to publicly profess his faith. An act Henry was incapable of, and underscoring their different worldviews. For unlike Henry, Brooks held out hope of awakening America to a realization of its destiny.\\""  At the end of Childs' intro he gives us his own opinions of American reform ca. WWII, wanting a government with the ability to make snap decisions (Heaven help us), blaming not the poor character of representatives but the Founding structure instead. (This view was on the wind after James Allen Smith's 1907 \\""Sprit Of American Government.\\"")<br /><br />As for Brooks' book: He begins with historical reference to the Spanish War in which war-follows-money. As trade routes and routines are blocked, change, or discoveries are made to shift them, so to goes world power. Insightful is Brooks' preconceiving of Jared Diamond's \\""Guns Germs and Steel\\"" as Brooks notes, \\""The peculiarity of the path of exchanges is that is lies east and west, not north and south.\\"" (This idea is thoroughly developed just two years later in \\""The New Empire.\\"") Brooks view is heavily weighted with a kind of harsh Darwinian survival-or-perish perspective when it comes to nations (and both Adams are rather positivist in their view). He acknowledges that one nation can ruin another, not by war but by trade (China/US) and sets off to chronicle effects of sugar production and pricing between regimes. There's also some amusing remarks sprinkled about, \\""In the United States where the use of sweets is said to be injuriously excessive...\\"" Sounding like a modern description of the US, \\""England's unrivaled productivity gave way to extravagance, amusement and loss of initiative, imports in excess over exports, a nation wasteful and profuse. Strangest of all is the mental inertia which prevents the Englishman from comprehending the world around him. He still looks on American competition as an accident...While Americans in particular have relied on England to police the globe and keep distant markets open, allowing her to sit at home to map her advantage without cost or danger.\\"" Brooks closes by noting that Russia's administration must change or suffer a major revolt (as it did 17 years later) and that the US was approaching world supremacy. But with the triumphs come scarifies and \\""fortune has seldom smiled on those who, besides being energetic and industrious, have not also been armed, organized and bold.\\"" Adams remains a striking figure in American history and this book, while far short of his bombshell \\""Law Of Civilization And Decay,\\"" fills in more of the Brooks perspective.","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

It's the sort that jumps off the page and slaps you.  Sometimes, that's ok.<br /><br />There is a cosmic threat that is heading to their universe, and it's up to a group of teenage sidekicks to save the day.  Due to events in the first book, things are looking dire and bleak.  Dire to the point of loss of limb and life.  And bleak to getting help from unfeeling higher powers.  In the face of that, what's a kid supposed to do?<br /><br />Having not read the first volume, I was a bit lost at first, and the first few pages are pretty shocking to say the least.  I would definitely recommend not starting here.  I can also tell you it's not the kind of story that is necessarily easy to follow along with.  Scenes shift in a nightmarish way.<br /><br />Having said that, there is much to like here.  I loved the splash page of every issue with it's throw back to different eras of comic books.  My favorite might have been the early 1990s parody one of the Danger Club team.  The art is good.  The story is shocking and in-your-face.

You may not like what he has to say but you should read it anyway. The book will help anyone understand the subject. The recent election and statements from the President elect shows how the Green issue is a major shapping force in American politics. Many people are worshiping at the Green alter. I know many don't understand what this Green thing is. Many view it as a feel good issue like don't club Baby seals. There isn't much argument to that. To others the green issue is a starting point to the one world government bent on destruction. This book shapes that issue in a new way that will help all parties. No matter what you believe this issue will truly haunt us in many different ways over the next few years.    Thomas Friedman here captures the issue like nothing else. Most books on the subject are nothing but sad stories about Bambi and the other creatures of the forest from nasel sounding failed politicians. All of those books were written by rich ex-politicans or whinny university professors who all don't have to worry about where their next meal is coming from. To 90% of the world living in the edge of poverty the Green religion has different meanings. This book takes a radically new approach to explaining things. He both shows the importance of the isse but tempers it with some reality.     Thomas's reality on the world is a good read. The first half of the book shows in great detail the status of the world. He in very clear detail shows how population for the third world is going through the roof. Then he discusses the impact from that unrestrained growth. This growth has a huge impact on other things and vice versa. Growing populations need more energy. As they burn that energy damage from pollution grows and the demand on supply increases pushing up price. Friedman's discussion of this angle is excellent. It is clear, concise, and very believable. Christians who read it will swear they are reading a description of the last days, though Mr. Friedman doesn't talk about that. He says the pressure from this situation demands a \\""Green Revolution\\"".    His ideas on how to start this revolution is really thought provoking. He has very specific ideas like a new electrical grid system for the country or how to use R&D monies to prime the research pump. Friedman's ideas do seem to rely heavily on optimism and humanism. His descriptions are very clear and entertaining. He has some little known stories that really enrich the story and do give hope. The stories make the issue real and not some vague ideology ex-liberals like to preach.     He does have some ideas worth exploring on the policy front. The recent President elect's radio speeches sound like he has read this book. I am sure we all will see these ideas debated on TV news over the next year or so. That is why I think everyone should read this book. It will help you understand events.","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

She does a great job of creating very expressive characters. She also does gorgeous work creating the domestic and nature scenes that are the backdrop for Toot and Puddle's conversations. I got an artists friend to look at the book (I was so excited about discovering it), and she agreed that the two paintings of Toot and Puddle outside in moonlit snow are brilliant.<br /><br />The thing I most love about this book is the emphasis on holidauys as a time we spend with the people we love. There is no big deal made about getting and giving presents. The only present we talk about is the lucky nut that Toot is given by his Great-Great-Aunt. Toot brings it home from Scotland and hangs it on the tree he shares with Puddle and Tulip.<br /><br />There is also no big deal made about Santa Claus. You may think you spot him, but you can't say for sure.<br /><br />Delightful! We have read this book three or four times a day for two weeks, and it looks as if it is going to take us through to Christmas Eve. The book ends by saying \\""when they wake it will be Christmas,\\"" and I fully expect that will be the last line of the last sleepytime book we read on Christmas Eve this year.","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

Some chapters even wander around chronologically without making that obvious on the first reading, leading to confusion and frustration (and loss of my time having to re-read chapters repeatedly).    The insets were nice (original documents, etc), but always appeared in weird spots where you'd have to keep reading before they made much sense.

The authors make this an interesting book by explaining their travels in order to get the last pictures of steam in operation in China.  Sadly, as the authors note, by the time they started shooting pictures, mainline steam had ended in China and this book focuses on the remaining out of the way operations that still used steam.  The pictures are beautiful (pages 79 and 80 are my personal favorites) though there is little technical data on the engines themselves.  The authors have done a good job of provinding locations for the pictures, and I actually enjoyed the stories of their travels.  Thankfully, the authors were able to gather the pictures they could before steam came to an end in yet another \\""emerging\\"" economy.","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

This is a team of individuals (six of them of course), all of which belong on someone's rouge gallery, bound together by some secret force in order to do some good.  Well, good insomuch that they're against the greater of two evils on their missions, which still counts right?  The cast is great and very diverse, and bounce off each other greatly. For at least the first story arc, you have Catman (a former Batman and Green Arrow villain), Cheshire (an assassin who historically plagued the Titans), Ragdoll (son of another villain), Deadshot (now affiliated the Suicide Squad), Parademon (of Apocalypse), and the leader of sorts, Scandal Savage (Vandal's daughter).  It's entertaining to watch the more moral characters deal with those whose amoral nature is only kept in check by situations, and I have to say that the interactions between the sane and not-so-sane can be hilarious as well.  Of all the characters, Catman is the most focused on - having both a twisted romance and a maybe bromance with some of his team - but Gail Simone does an excellent job highlighting the other members as well.  They're well flushed out and complex characters, and you'll have no problem rooting for the historically-speaking bad guys for the most part.<br /><br />The book is divided into two major story arcs, given since the volume collects Villains United #1-6 and Secret Six #1-6, with a little bit of filler inbetween in Villains United: Infinite Crisis Special #1.  At first, a various group of villains (Lex Luthor, Talia al'Ghul, Doctor Psycho, Black Adam, and Deathstroke) decide to form a society of their own, as a sort of protection agency following what was revealed about Doctor Light.  Most villains join their fold, but Catman has no interest while the others are already formed into a group and are engaged fighting them. Their head, Mockingbird, has them recruit Catman, following an event that pushes Catman to willingly join them in opposition to Luthor's group.  Mockingbird is no benevolent benefactor, as going against his wishes will result in consequences they wish to avoid, particularly concerning their loved ones.  So under their leader's mysterious orders, they carry out missions to sabotage the other villains' society. The latter story deals with the Savage family, and a disagreement between Scandal and her father Vandal, and new recruits to replace what they had already lost.<br /><br />The art is great and really carries the story, so there are no complaints.  Simone's writing just draws you in, presenting you with interesting characters that don't fail to entertain.  This book would definitely be enjoyed by many, and not just those who like the Suicide Squad since it has far more to it than a similar premise on the surface and shared character.  It does have things that are more steeped in traditional DC lore, some of which wasn't carried over to the New 52 or whatever the canon is now, but nothing that would dissuade or turn off a newer reader.  Overall, the story is greatly entertaining and well worth the buy, especially for how much comic you are getting for your buck.","2015-08-14","2015","Books"

Picking up mere moments after the first book left off, LILY DALE: BELIEVING has Calla finding herself the target of a serial killer targeting teenage girls, a case that first came to light in book one. However, reading \\""Awakening\\"" is not required to enjoy LILY DALE: BELIEVING for it stands quite well on its own. Calla is still trying to deal with the unexpected loss of her mother, the realization of her own medium abilities and adjusting to life in Lily Dale with her unique grandmother Odel and the physical distance between her and her father. Add in the normal teenager issues and things can get pretty complicated. What I like most about Calla is her willingness to learn about her newfound abilities, something that's much changed from her behavior in book one. The fact that we see things from both the killer's point of view several times during the story adds a creepiness to the book that keeps the reader rapidly turning the pages, knowing that at some point there will be a meeting between he and Calla.     Threads left unsolved from the first book continue on in book two, and with BELIEVING's own startling ending it will no doubt leave readers waiting anxiously for book three releasing November 2008.

I am a non-fiction reader, usually, so, reviewing poetry brings me back 25 years... Most of the poetry is very masterful.  Reading, grabbing, pulling, bringing the reader to a state of discomfort.  It's not the kind of reading that is meant to bring one to a state of peace.  It is, rather, masterful poetry and artwork designed to help the reader to, usually on a more idiological or individual basis, see the injustices of the current circumstances - while mostly in Palestine, but, well beyond.  It helps the reader to realize injustices.  Often, it approaches, as Fox News purports, a more fair and balanced reporting than do the other sides.  If the reader is looking for a work to inspire, provoke, or work one's way through the western media blitzkrieg, then this book is highly recommended.  This work is not designed to bring about further acts of injustice - it is a reflection on the past injustices alone.  A planet of peace is the goal.  Imagine the discussions, the advancement of the Palestinian cause, the bringing to peace, if such a masterpiece were in the hands of every American and Israeli child.

At first the story seems to feature Brianna O’Leary but before long her sister Colleen quickly gains a very important role. With the O’Leary horse farm facing financial difficulties, father James believes it can be saved if both daughters marry well and a well-placed marriage of foster son Gilbert would not hurt the chances of a successful bank loan. With all his manipulation, James fails to consider the desires of others involved in his planning.<br /><br />As another reviewer stated, I much preferred Brianna at the beginning and thought Colleen was not at all nice – especially to her sister. Somewhere along the way, my preference did an about face and I realized that Colleen was not the villain I had thought but was acting out of misplaced guilt and shame. A love interest that took her entirely by surprise changed her outlook and helped her find true faith. Brianna, on the other hand, became more rebellious and found it difficult to trust Gilbert or Colleen. I was more and more frustrated with Gilbert as he allowed James to manipulate his life rather than stand up for what he really wanted.<br /><br />All-in-all, “Irish Meadows” was an intriguing story that held my interest. Of all the characters I think I liked Rylan the best, even if he vacillated about what he wanted for awhile also. Pick up a copy to find out for yourself how things turn out for Irish Meadows and the O’Leary family. There might be a few surprises in store.<br /><br />This book was provided for review by LitFuse Publicity.","2015-08-14","2015","Books"

The Myth of Multitasking: How \\""Doing It All\\"" Gets Nothing Done by Dave Crenshaw.  It's taken me a few years to realize it, but the more I try to do at one time, the less effective I seem to be at any one thing.  Crenshaw uses a story setting to illustrate the problem in a way that anyone should be able to relate to...<br /><br />Contents:<br />The Company; The Owner; The Lie; The Cost; The Origin; The Exercise; The Example; The Question; The Meeting; The Expectation; The Truth; The Deal; The Change; The Steps; The Systems; The Follow-up; Worksheets: Switchtasking Exercise, Reports Worksheet, Recurring Meetings Worksheet, Truth of Time Worksheet; Sources; The Author<br /><br />The story used in The Myth of Multitasking follows Helen, the head of a clothing company.  She's the stereotypical executive, doing ten things at once, and convinced that without her \\""outstanding\\"" ability to multitask, nothing would get done.  But she wonders why she feels she is getting less and less done, even though she's busier than ever.  Phil, an executive coach, has been hired by Helen to help her get a handle on her schedule before she goes off the deep end.  When he walks her through a typical hour comprised of tasks, emails, phone calls, and staff questions, she thinks she has a full 60 minutes to focus on a particular task.  But in reality, she really only has about 32 minutes, and of that only 10 minutes of uninterrupted time at any given stretch.  This is due to the cost of switching tasks, the time it takes to pick up the thread of a new demand and shut down the old one before you can concentrate.  So instead of multitasking (doing multiple things at once), she's really \\""switchtasking\\"" (doing multiple things sequentially with the associated overhead of switching between them).  And that's where the myth of multitasking lies...  we can't do more than one primary thing at once.  We can only switch back and forth between two or more items, and that's an expensive operation in terms of time.<br /><br />Crenshaw uses this story to explain how multitasking can damage relationships, because you're never really \\""there\\"" for anyone.  As such, they feel as if they must get your time whenever it's possible because they may not see you again for hours.  If you set aside regular scheduled times that they can count on, the pressing tasks seem to calm down and wait to be handled during the times they know they'll have your full attention.  Once this more realistic schedule is in place, fewer demands come all at once, and switchtasking diminishes, leaving you with more time to be productive.<br /><br />I've fallen into the same trap of trying to juggle multiple things at once, thinking I was being hyper-productive.  In reality, I now see that I've been doing a lot of things adequately, but very little exceptionally.  At worst, this book has reminded me that I need to focus more on a micro and macro level on the current task I'm doing, rather than trying to keep other things on my radar at the same time.  At best, it's given me the momentum that I need to get back to a more structured schedule, instead of letting the urgent overwhelm the important.  Highly recommended..., and that's an expensive operation in terms of time.

What I read was a story about a person who put themselves in huge difficulty because they simply did not do their due diligence in preparing for a tough hiking trip. From the glowing reviews I read it seems like some folks found Ms Strayed surviving an appalling lack of preparation as a somehow noble and praiseworthy act, but I found it ridiculous. As an outdoor professional I have seen way too many people do similar things with far more tragic results. These people tax the resources of the Eastern Sierra Nevada towns that have to go look for them, endangering the rangers and law enforcement officials doing the searches in the process.<br />Ms Strayed, you were not a hero.

(A no-brainer, I admit, but I ain't proud... sometimes the obvious is the also the best.)

A People's History of Christianity. Byzantine Christianity. Vol. 3.  Minneapolis: Fortress Press. 2006, pp. 252. $25.55.   Derek Krueger, editor, is Professor of Religious Studies and head of the department at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.  Among his many publications is Writing and Holiness: The Practice of Authorship in the Early Christian East (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004).  Byzantine Christianity is the third of a seven volume series which, \\""introduces the question, What did Byzantine Christians do?\\""   The author states in the foreword that this seven-volume series breaks new ground by looking at Christianity's past from the vantage point of a people's history.  It is church history, yes, but church history with a difference: \\""Church,\\"" the author insist, is not to be understood first and foremost as the hierarchal-institutional-bureaucratic corporation; rather, above all, it is the laity, the ordinary faithful people. Their religious lives, their pious practices, their self-understandings as Christians, and the way all of this grew and changed over the last two millennia-this is the unexplored territory in which the author declares he is setting foot\\"" (xiii).   This book consists of ten chapters divided into three parts, each chapter written by different authors. Part one covers: Congregations and Preachers with chapter divisions on the Lay Piety in the Sermons of John Chrysostom, The Cult of the Martyrs and the Cappadocian Fathers, and Romanos and the Night Vigil in the Sixth Century.  Part two covers Places, Spaces, and Rites with chapters on Shrines, Festivals, and the \\""Undistinguished Mob\\"", The Layperson in Church, and the Death and Dying of Byzantium.  Part three covers Devotional Life and Artifacts with chapters on Icons, Prayer, and Vision in the Eleventh Century, Objects of Devotion and Protection, The Religious Lives of Children and Adolescents, and the Devotional life of Laywomen.     As a seminarian, one of the class projects was to visit the Annunciation Greek Orthodox Cathedral and the Rothko Chapel here in Houston, after reading Derek Krueger's Byzantine Christianity.  In reading Krueger's book, it brought clarity to this experience and it also helped me to appreciate some of their culture, which is vastly different from Protestants and Evangelicals.  Difference does not always mean that one or the other's practices or perspectives are incorrect or not in line with some aspects of the Christian faith, it just means there are different ways of worshipping and practicing one's faith.     Krueger states that in answering the question \\""what did Byzantine Christians do?, one must consider how people prayed and how often they attended services; how they celebrated, married, and mourned; how they interacted with priests, monks, nuns, and holy laypeople; where they went on pilgrimage and why they visited shrines; how they transmitted religious values to their children; and how they performed acts of charity, and also what ordinary Christians did in church, in their homes or worships, about their veneration of saints or their use of icons, about their visual and material culture and about the place of religion in the course of their lives, are what illuminate a people's Christianity (2).     Krueger deals with each of these aspects in great detail, focusing on the religious practices and the challenges of telling the history of Christianity in Byzantium.  Interestingly, he states \\""while Orthodox theology investigated ways to understand God and creation, humanity's participation in Christ's work of redemption, and how the divine might be present in images, much of Byzantine religious activity sought solutions to practical problems.  Christianity offered therapies for physical ailments, protection from illness and demons, and the salvation of the soul after death. Krueger describes their Christian devotion both publically and private, their festivals and vigils whichprovided opportunities for collective expressions of devotion to Christ and the saints, and often standardized through hymns and liturgies (3).     Being a female and a preacher in seminary the most interesting part of the book for me, though it was the last chapter, was the chapter on the devotional life of laywomen.  I must give Krueger and all of the author's of The People's History credit, because they give women a  prominent place in history and in the life of the church.  He states \\""religious faith and devotional practices played a significant part in the lives of Byzantine women, especially those of the middle and upper classes, whose daily life was quite circumscribed.  Prayer, Bible study, and the veneration of icons at home offered spiritual comfort, while attendance at church services, participation in religious processions, visit to holy shrines, and charitable activities provided approved opportunities to leave the confines of the home (201).   I would highly recommend this book to the students of Church history and Christianity, Bible College students and seminarians.  If students are interested in learning about the \\""Byzantine Christianity, which developed as a distinct system of religious practice and devotion, different from the medieval Roman Catholicism emerging simultaneously in the west\\"", this book is a must read.","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

While waiting for the McCawbers to show up, I failed to appreciate what is now one of my favorite books.  Dickens hints around a subject in a way infinitely more powerful than plainly stating it and evokes deepest emotions in plainly stated phrases.  For anyone turned off by the intricate and meticulous way the story develops, a second read makes the importance of minor incidents clear and gives the writing its full force of Mystery and Faith.<br /><br />Dickens's signature humor appears through Miss Pross, Mr. Stryver and Mr. Cruncher.  I loved Miss Pross's beatification of her degenerate brother and Mr. Cruncher's imperiled vow to leave Mrs. Cruncher the superintendence of her own future \\""flopping.\\""<br /><br />However, the brilliant language must inevitably lead from the innocent drinking spilled wine off the dusty streets of Paris, to the Reign of Terror and, ultimately, La Guillotine.  A sense of awe and foreboding lurks within every line and only the faith of Darnay and Carton can withstand the relentless grind of Revenge.<br /><br />I try to read A Tale of Two Cities with the attitude of understanding a foreign language and ask myself what every word means in the sense here used.  By this approach, although it's impossible for me to adequately describe what makes me shiver while reading Dickens, I can confidently state, that A Tale of Two Cities lives and teems with it.","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

For example:<br /><br />&#34;Bright green eelgrass under the spring-fed river swayed as if in slow motion. A few bream swam past. Above water, the orange-leafed cypress trees made islands in the middle of the river. The Spanish moss draping them looked like ladies’ stockings drying languid in the sun.<br /> …<br />Ospreys and even eagles soared over the swamp grass, which looked like wheat, spotted with small clearings where water lay, reflecting the brilliant blue sky.&#34;<br /><br />As that passage illustrates, Ryals gets the tone and the language and the pacejust right in the descriptions of this island community and its peoples. As well perhaps she should since she has lived near the northern Gulf coast of Florida most of her life and is the official Poet Laureate of the Big Bend of North Florida.","2015-08-14","2015","Books"

I went ahead a bought the collector's edition because I really wanted to see the book in the form that she intended it to be.  However, I so wanted to read the tales that I could not wait until the CE arrived from Amazon.  So I went out and bought the standard edition as well.      I just compared to two editions and found some unexpected differences.  Beyond the metal corners and the reprint of Rowling's handwritten introduction, found only in the collector's edition, the standard edition does not have all of Rowling's illustrations!  For instance, in The Wizard and the Hopping Pot, the illustrations of the \\""pot, slipper and note,\\"" (page 27 of CE), as well as the \\""wizard (son) and women with the baby,\\"" (pg. 32) are missing.  The illustration of the \\""warlock courting the maiden\\"" (pg. 90) in The Warlock Hairy Heart -  a piece that I thought was particularly beautiful - is nowhere to be found in the standard edition either.  So, if you are still debating whether you should spend the money on the CE, you may want consider how important the illustrations are to you.      BTW, while I understand that certain sacrifices had to made for the standard edition, I don't think it was really fair to the standard edition buyers to remove actual material from Rowling's work - even if they were just the illustrations. . . . Yeah, I know the Editors, nor Rowling, asked for my opinion, but I thought I would give it anyway.  Take it for what it is worth.","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

I just didn't really like this book.  It was a really easy read, and the premise was something I would have normally liked, but I just couldn't feel for the characters like I normally would.<br /><br />The plot of the book is pretty simple, girl falls for boy, boy has troubled past, but oops, girl is also a half dream being that can live in both the human world and the world of dreams.  Girl then finds something evil stalking boy in his dreams and has to help vanquish it, but since she's been denying her abilities to walk in dreams for 28 years she isn't equipped to help him with it.<br /><br />For starters, the author kept talking about the male hero (Noah) being troubled, but she never actually tells us why he's so troubled, just that he is.  She skirts around the issue so much its almost overboard to make him seem so dark and brooding.  Another problem I have with this book is that the heroine (Dawn) doesn't really ever seem to deal with her issues by the end of the book.  They just all seem to disappear, which just made me even more confused.  There's a subplot with Dawn and her mother and by the end of the book I would have thought it would have been resolved but it was left open-ended.  I don't know if she's setting this up for more books about the same heroine or what but it just didn't work for me.","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

It continues into some intermediate information that should be fundamental knowledge for all embedded systems designers and developers.  With advances in development tools and massive increases system complexity, these basics are often overlooked because developers become more cubby-holed into specific, well-defined roles on a project.  They can lose sight of the fact that they are designing/coding an embedded system, with all the differences from desktops or larger systems that have more extensive and faster system resources.  Understanding these fundamentals will help cast their work in a more appropriate perspective.     Many vital and expected topics are included, such as memory mapping, architecture, coding the hardware, design tools, etc. Berger includes other topics such as the \\""From the Trenches\\"" vignettes based on his own experiences, that give concrete examples to illustrate several concepts.    A good discussion is the concept of hardware/software partitioning, an early architecture decision that affects the entire development program down the line.  This is often overlooked - once the design team has decided to implement a function in hardware, for example, it may often be impossible to upgrade the functionality. Sometimes bugs in hardware may be compensated for in FPGAs and in software, but this is not an ideal contingency plan.     Berger spends significant time on debugging and testing, two critical aspects of the development cycle whose effective approach is usually the difference between an on-time delivery and a lower quality product.

I enjoy reading about history and found the book quite interesting in that it wasn't a history book per se, but a look at historical events and society's reaction to those events.  It not a book that you can read and look into the future and know what is going to happen. I have since re-read the book twice, once in 2006 leading up to the elections and again right after the 2008 election.  I find it quite amazing that the reviews that give the book only 1 or 2 stars that were written in 2000-2001 panned the book because they could not or did not see some of the things occurring and the general mood of the country changing.     With the economic situation we have in December of 2008 how many news references have we seen that compares today with the 1930's?  By 2008, we can see that the millennial generation is, by and large, a generation of good kids following the rules. More so than my generation (13er). Drug use is down, abortions are down, crime rate down. They are the generation fighting a war in Afghanistan and Iraq. They are not protesting the war on college campuses.  They may not agree with the war, but the majority of anti-war protests are organized and run by older Americans (Boomers?) and even those protest have been small and, really, insignificant. These kids have overwhelmingly supported Barack Obama. They have turned out to support him when, as young adults, other generations' support for presidential candidates has been lukewarm at best. Obama has continually been compared to Lincoln and FDR, the two presidents during America's prior 4th Turnings.     Is the book perfect? No. Do the authors sometimes overgeneralize? Yes. But overall, their theory is quite plausible and over the course of the last eight years, I can see their theory occurring. After reading this book, newspaper articles that seemed benign now have a whole different twist if read through the prism of generational changes. If you enjoy reading history, this is book that looks at history from a different perspective. If your looking for a crystal ball book, this is not the book for you. If you're looking for insight as to why things happen, this is a most interesting book.","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

These books are especially helpful because they include recipes for desserts that still have the cream cheese, milk, etc., but don't call for the eggs. Usually for lacto-vegetarians, the only cookbooks that try to achieve these recipes without eggs are all out vegan. Which is fine, but you don't always want to swap your dairy out for tofu if you don't have to.    For simple recipes like butter cakes and quickbreads, lacto-vegetarians can just use a traditional recipe and swap the eggs out for a little extra baking powder, some yogurt, etc., but that's not possible for the more interesting, elaborate, and indulgent desserts -- which this book covers. It has recipes with all the taste and texture of the traditional versions because the dairy is still there, like mousses,  cheesecakes, and sponge cakes.     That being said, this book also seems to cater to a slightly different palette than a lot of Americans will probably relate to. Plenty of the recipes are great, but others (grape mousse?) aren't the best. The instructions also aren't as crystal clear as they could be, and it was produced on the cheap. That's awesome as far as price goes, but it does detract in terms of presentation, as the pictures are largely black and white, and probably didn't have a professional food photographer on hand to make everything look as heavenly as possible.     So it's a good book to have in your lacto-vegetarian kitchen, but it's not as great as another book that's also called Eggless Desserts, but by a different author, Tarla Dalal. But of course, if you're lacto veg and you love making dessert, there's no reason not to have both. The only catch is that since this book was written for a particular readership, the ingredients are still in metric, (I just wrote the conversions in the book as I went through it).     Also, there are some ingredients that might at first leave Americans scratching their heads -- but don't worry, none of them are scary. Occasionally a recipe calls for \\""curd,\\"" and this is basically a really thick yogurt. If you happen to have an Indian grocery store nearby, you can buy it there, but otherwise just pick up some Greek yogurt from the Whole Foods or Trader Joe's -- it's very thick, and if you want it to be even thicker, you can just spoon it into a paper towel, wrap it up for a few minutes and get some of the water out. It won't even stick to the paper towel.    Another such ingredient is agar agar or \\""China grass.\\"" This is a colorless, tasteless powdered product made from seaweed that is basically a vegetarian gelatin (it's used in some very cool recipes, more of which I thought only non-veggies could eat, since gelatin is made from animal products). This can also be found at health food stores, or at Asian Groceries. And lastly, some recipes call for \\""custard powder,\\"" which is a British product. You can find it in the British import section of the grocery store, but the product itself is just cornstarch with vanilla and a dash of salt -- it's basically just pudding mix, where you add your own sugar. So if you can't find custard powder, you can substitute it easily for cornstarch and maybe an extra dash of vanilla if you feel like it.","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

Along the way, she meets a man named Mike(who happens to kill coyotes for the government) that presents her with a tiny baby coyote pup that she raises as a pet.      The book chronicles her life during the fist few years of her life with Charlie, (the coyote) as well as her relationship with Mike- though the story predominantly focuses on Charlie.     To earn a living, Shreve sets up a subscription service on the internet for people to receive a photo a day of Charlie which eventually leads to a blog. (and later yet, a book deal.) She reveals that the blog garners her a great deal of both positive and negative attention about her raising a wild coyote pup. I sympathized with her over this, though I guess it was somewhat to be expected. I applauded her when she said that once she grew weary over the verbally violent flame wars that would develop on the site, that she removed the comment section altogether.     Shreve has a distinct gift for writing, as well as for photography, and her pictures of Charlie and the beautiful Wyoming wilderness are liberally scattered throughout the book.     My only complaint is that I wish she had not revealed that she only had 6 months to complete the book. The book does in some places read like a personal diary, and it can be repetitive, especially with regards to her clothing. I appreciated the little details about her life, but I was more interested in what kinds of meals she prepared with a grocery store hours away rather than what dirty clothes she put on that day. I think that with more time, this book could have been a knock it out of the park classic if she would have been able to further flesh out her own struggles with daily life, rather than focusing mostly about Charlie.     There are some truly golden nuggets of wisdom in this book, and while it is a story about a woman and her coyote, I wanted more about how she adapted to a rural lifestyle after having moved from the city.     With regards to her decisions on how she raised Charlie, I have no judgments and I respected her decisions. When she had difficulties, I appreciated how she would diligently seek answers, including reaching for Caesar Milan's book when Charlie started showing aggression.     It's a good read, and I hope to see another book from her - one that will continue her own journey.","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

It starts off a bit weakly, with rather broad generalizations about Chinese thought and culture and a less-than critical take on Confucius, apparently treating the entire Analects as representing reliable records of his statements.  It's generally believed these were compiled over a long period, with some material neither originating with Confucius nor representing his thought.  A couple chapters are markedly Taoist and even anti-Confucian, but Creel only mentions them in passing, suggesting they can be reconciled with Confucian thought.  It's hard to see how, but Creel doesn't elaborate.  No doubt Creel knew his subject well and the simplistic impression is due to brevity, but a caveat or two would have helped.    However, Creel becomes considerably more critical regarding both texts and concepts as he moves on to Mo Tzu, Mencius, the Taoists, Hsun Tzu, the Legalists, etc.  There's still simplification, but this can't be avoided in such a short work, and his combining philosophical with political history is quite helpful.  This is particularly true as Chinese philosophy has often had a pronounced political orientation (even Taoism, in reacting against this focus), as many of the leading thinkers served in government or aspired to, and as the state and emperors have typically aligned themselves publicly with a particular philosophy (with varying degrees of sincerity).    Another strength is the book's inclusion of post-classical philosophy, continuing through the Communist state's establishment.  It's hard to find brief, popular works on Chinese philosophy that cover its entire history, much less ones that do it well and place ideas in historical and political context (Fung Yu-Lan's Short History may be another, but I've just started it).  Necessarily the result is a synopsis rather than treatment in depth, but Creel does thisquite well.  In little space he sheds considerable light on the philosophical eclecticism of the Han Dynasty, Buddhism's introduction to China and its evolution and impacts there, neo-Confucianism, reactions against it, and Western influence.    This background is helpful in trying to understand China's difficulties and struggles during the twentieth century, and Creel gives a very plausible explanation for the quick and fairly widespread acceptance of Communism by both the Chinese people and the intellectuals.  At the end of the book he lapses again into some breezy generalizations and perhaps a touch of romanticizing, although not without some useful insights.  Overall it's a very good book and one wishes Creel were available for a final word on China today.","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

There was definately an \\""It's over\\"" moment from fox when this show was abruptly ended and it's wonderful magic never caught on again as much as one would like. The movie couldn't bring what I loved about the show back and the same goes for this somic but for different reasons.<br />This book is not set after the movie, the setting would be before it, yet not a prelude like the other. This is like an episode which never aired in comic book form. So we know that whatever happens here won't have any repercussions on a grander story in the making. The good thing about this is that you get the good old feeling of the team from the TV series again. Wash is alive and kicking and Book is with them on the ship, so is Inara. It reminds you of how great the show was, but it only lasts 3 issues with nthing telling you that there is hope for more Firefly goodness later.<br />But, these three issues seen independently of anything else, are fantastic and if you liked the show, then you'll love these. They're written by Joss so every character sounds like they should. What I really love is how it reffers to previous episodes. For example, you'll see how far and wide the Hero of Campton's tale has been spread :) Art wise, it is the same artist as the previous comic and he makes most of the characters look very similar to the show, with the exception of Wash. Wash looks like a regular white guy. But Mal and the rest look perfect.<br /><br />If you are a fan of nostalgia, then this is definately the book for you.","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

This is not the case. This is merely a reference material that explains all the concepts of Spanish grammar organized by sections (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) and not in an order that is conducive to learning (you need to learn a little bit about nouns and verbs at the same time, so you can start forming sentences!) Also, its explanations are given under the assumption that the reader is knowledgeable of grammatical concepts (what a direct object is, an indirect object, etc.) and has a solid Spanish vocabulary (the exercises in the book are scant, but often ask you to translate English sentences into Spanish -- not only do you need to know the grammatical concepts taught in the book, but you also need to know the vocabulary needed to translate the sentences, something not really covered).<br /><br />That being said, this is an excellent reference material. Need to know the irregular preterite stem of \\""poder\\""? Just go to the well-organized table of contents to find the page where it's listed. Forgot the imperfect subjunctive endings? They're all listed in an easy-to-find, easy-to-read format. So although it is a perfect reference guide, its title is completely misleading. As a \\""basic\\"" text it completely fails. As a reference text I give it 5 stars, as a beginner's text I give it 1 star, hence my 3-star rating.<br /><br />For the beginner Spanish student, I highly recommend the book Spanish Now! Level 1 (and later Spanish Now! Level 2). I also recommend the book 6,000+ Essential Spanish Words to help build your vocabulary. For a great Spanish dictionary, look no further than [...] a free online dictionary that covers a multitude of languages. It has not only a Spanish-English/English-Spanish Dictionary (that gives you precise meanings of words -- all the nuances that are important for picking the right translation) but a monolingual Spanish dictionary as well (to get definitions of Spanish words in Spanish).translation) but a monolingual Spanish dictionary as well (to get definitions of Spanish words in Spanish).","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

Please keep in mind, this is not the type of book that you buy to read (if you wish to learn about astrology) -- It is an astrological mathematical tool. To be more definitive, a Table of Houses provides the house cusps used in time calculations and is standard for work in the Placidian system.<br /><br />Primarily, this material is best used by those interested in becoming an astrologer AND they who need to or have an expressed desire to learn how to create a birth chart manually -- in other words, without the use of astrology computer generated software or internet-ready natal charts. I've heard many people say how difficult it is to create charts by hand, but then again that's how prior astrologers did it and quite frankly, I believe that an aspiring astrologer should not only know, but master the technique as well. Whose to say that you'll always have access to a computer.<br /><br />The Spherical Basis by Dalton (if I'm not mistaken--please correct me if so, but it is out of production due to its age), however, the book to date still comes highly recommended and is extremely comprehensive in the amount of information it provides as it pertains to natal charting.","2015-08-14","2015","Books"

Then look no further. Finally, after the initial discovery of Chiron in 1977, an astrologer has managed to decode Chiron's true meaning.<br /><br />While there are definitely several excellent books in print on the basics of Chiron (Barbara Hand Clow, Melanie Reinhart, Richard Nolle and Zane Stein, for instance), Martin is the only astrologer, to my knowledge, who has actually gotten to the core of Chiron's essence: healing.<br /><br />As an astrologer myself, I find his research an invaluable aide, and look forward to utilizing his methods in my own practice.<br /><br />As someone with a strong Chiron presence in my own natal chart, I devoured the explanations (and even understood them!) he has so meticulously composed.  The book flows well and is perfectly organized, which satisfies my Mercury-in-Virgo-driven-by-Pluto-in-Leo nature.  Not surprising, since Martin's Mercury is also in Virgo and conjunct his Pluto.<br /><br />Although one reviewer seemed to be irritated at Martin's frequent reference to the `gift in the wound,' the fact is, that is the whole point of his work: the gift is in the wound. As Martin points out, once the key to Chiron has been found and its healing essence accessed, it's only a matter of time before the native will discover that what they've historically believed to be their bane, has actually turned out to be the best part of and the key to understanding who they are and why they are here.<br /><br />As for a more in-depth treatment of Chiron in and in aspect to the Houses: there's always someone who begins the process, which is necessary.  Maybe it's up to someone else out there to provide that extra treatment one feels -- in their opinion -- is lacking.<br /><br />Remember: we all stand on the shoulders of others, regardless of what we do. Without astrologers such as Martin Lass we might not have made it even this far.<br /><br />Kudos again, Martin.  Excellent book!","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

Though on the Internet there is an enormous amount of authoritative and compelling information questioning the official account of 9/11, there is nothing that can equal a top-quality print production chock-full of photographs, maps, news clippings, graphs, and caricatures.    Attractive and color-coded in its layout, this inviting 352-page book presents, in highly readable form, the best of \\""Global Outlook\\"" from its inception in Spring 2002, to the Spring/Summer 2005 edition.      WHY IS THIS BOOK IMPORTANT?    Now that we are seven years out from 9/11, a lot of people are shrugging and saying that it's part of history, and that we have to move on.    What they forget is that the world we live in now has been transformed by this pivotal event, and that our media have failed to keep faith with the truth surrounding the origins of this ugly new \\""necessity\\"" we have all accepted and learned to live with - the \\""war on terror\\"".    As you page through this remarkable compendium, you will see the tug of war which has been taking place between those who have promulgated and supported the official story, and those who have researched the blatant contradictory falsehoods that were contrived to justify the immediately resulting and monstrously aggressive US foreign policy in the Middle East.      For example, there is an excellent analysis of the \\""straw man\\"" approach used by \\""Popular Mechanics\\"" to debunk the claims of the 9/11 truth community, followed by a rational rebuttal of the PM approach, and an exposé of all that \\""Popular Mechanics\\"" ignored.  There is a particularly relevant analysis of the seismic spikes that accompanied the collapse of the twin towers.    There is additional coverage of many ancillary issues, such as the \\""Silent Death of theTruVote System\\"", which concerns the mysterious death of Athan Gibbs, inventor of an electronic voting machine which offered a paper trail, right before the 2004 election.  A book could be written about this, and should be.    People say there are no whistle-blowers about what happened on 9/11, and that if government complicity were involved, we would have heard from them by now.  But there ARE - they just can't get coverage in the media.  This volume contains FBI whistle-blower Sibel Edmonds' open letter to Thomas Kean, Chairman of the 9/11 Commission.  The events of 9/11, including the paralysis of society as a whole to face up to them, has been dubbed by Webster Tarpley as \\""A Coup against Western Civilization\\"".    A feature article by theologian and renowned 9/11 scholar, Dr. David Ray Griffin, \\""Truth and Politics of 9/11: Omissions and Distortions of the `9/11 Commission Report'\\"", strongly indicates that the conclusion that the attacks succeeded because of official complicity is \\""virtually inescapable\\"".  (Griffin's latest book, \\""The New Pearl Harbor Revisited\\"" (Oct. 2008), was awarded \\""pick of the week\\"" by \\""Publishers Weekly\\"" on November 24, 2008 - a distinction given to only 51 published books every year.)    Altogether there are about a hundred short, well-indexed treatments of all that has been discovered about this extraordinary event, but which has not reached the light of day.    Ian Woods, the editor of \\""Global Outlook\\"", has produced another brilliant volume on 9/11, aided by contributing editors Barrie Zwicker, an independent journalist and documentary film producer, and Terry Burrows, M.D., a Toronto family physician.    Theirs is a vitally important publication. It's the kind of thing you can't put down.  It's highly affordable!  Buy half a dozen, and educate the people in your life who still don't understand it.","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

Steer a raucus bunch away from the crystal and don't place a sippy cup in an enchanting lady's manicured hand.\\""<br /><br />That's one of two things wrong with this book. The first, as shown above, is that too often do the authors write to see their own words. Contrary to what they believe, it's not good writing when you use three full sentences just to say \\""use the good stuff at a fancy event.\\"" For that matter, use the good stuff for your guests no matter what. That's what a real gentleman would do.<br /><br />Moving away from too-cute asides and lexiphanic verbosity, the second thing wrong with this book is that it has very little to do with being a gentleman, modern or otherwise. Skinny dipping, intimate rendevous, crashing parties, public drinking - and that's all BEFORE the chapter on vice, which discusses sex and substance abuse.<br /><br />I don't know what these guys call the definition of a modern gentleman, but the entire book is filled with crass behavior diguised as what most would call just \\""being a guy.\\"" But here's the deal: being a guy is awesome. I AM one and I think it's great! This book deals with that very well, but adds to the greatness of guyness by giving endless tips on how to be a BETTER guy. These tips include jukebox mastery, throwing parties, being well-versed in literature and pretty much being as cool as one man could possibly be, while not actually being gentlemanly.<br /><br />There may be a few pointers on gentlemanly behavior inside these boring and wordy pages, but chivalry and charm are not what this book is about. This book is about looking cool, getting over on the rules of society, telling good lies, using Cliff Notes to cram \\""knowledge,\\"" hooking up with coworkers and using incriminating photos of friends as blackmail.

And that one broke her leg upon arrival, proudly announcing she had researched the title on one leg!<br />Well, that one leg certainly did not take her very far.<br /><br />To start with, the book only covers the most superficial overview of the country. It lacks any real insight into the culture and history, and even the coverage of sights is so limited that I found more info on things to see in the local tourist office publications!<br /><br />Now for the practical info, which is what most people buy Lonely Planet guides for.<br />This is even worse!<br />The maps are awful. Even the simple walking tour map of the capital has streets and attractions misplaced on it, making it obvious the author has never walked it on that one leg.<br />Hotel recommendations? I have very soon given up even reading them! For the budget category, the recommendations are totally useless, with much better value options readily found by simply looking or asking around. For the higher end, I often found that hotels described as the best in town were now ages old, run-down and certainly not the best in twon for at least a decade!<br />Transport? Now this is where sheer laziness and carelessness is most obvious! More often than not, totally different (as much as 10 times!) fares are given for the very same journey depending on at which of the 2 towns it starts/ends in you look up in this book. The very same road may be described as excellent (correct) from the north, but as awful (outdated info) from the south. In fact I am very surprised that LP's usually very strict editors failed to pick all these errors!<br /><br />And I could go on endlessly...<br />But in short, if you are going to Madagascar, whether on an organized tour or as a backpacker, you should definitely avoid wasting your money on this book! Its sole English-language competition the [[ASIN:1841621978 Bradt Guide to Madagascar]], is far more informative and accurate. In fact this is not much of a secret any more. Unusually for any country, I saw hardly anyone else in Madagascar travelling with Lonely Planet, with almost everyone using Bradt.<br /><br />This book should never have left the publisher.<br />The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that if you simply can not get hold of the Bradt guide (as I could not in Asia) this one still gives you the most basic ideas about what to see and how to get around the country.going to Madagascar, whether on an organized tour or as a backpacker, you should definitely avoid wasting your money on this book!

Think about this: A pirate captain had to manage a crew made up in large part of uneducated misfits, many of them not qualified for their jobs. Not much to work with, it would seem. And yet, some of these captains managed to achieve successful careers--with methods that managers and supervisors in today's business world would find useful.    The book shows you how to identify the factors that motivate each individual. As the author points out, people are motivated by their own reasons, not yours. Heatherly writes about setting goals, teambuilding, communication and a number of other topics, showing not only how to do each effectively, but also why he's suggesting what he suggests. The book is written with the approach of working with people and bringing out their strengths, not authoritatively trying to force everyone into the mold of a good little drone worker.    Even if you're not a workplace manager, chances are you can find concepts that would be useful in, say, running a household, coaching a team, or any number of other situations. And, as a bonus, you'll learn a few interesting things about pirates.","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

After having read all the reviews I can easily tell the gender of the reviewer - no surprise.  If you are a guy you hate it and the women love it - once again no big surprise.  My wife gave this book to me for my birthday - Unreal- especially since I am a little busy finishing up a full time 28 month graduate school program - in Nursing.  Now, I ask you, I am a non-gay male nurse - how much more sensative can a man get!?  But, after reading the words of this author - obviously not near enough! Anyway, I digress, today she blamed me for not getting over issues with my childhood and that she will look for her own place after Christmas - this is while I was studying for my Board certification exam - nice timing!  According to the author, I should applaud her though!!!    I wondered where the heck did this come from - sort of out of left field - so I picked up the book and started reading - Unreal!  When I stopped laughing - I wondered two things. First, how close was this guy with his mother, a little too close if you ask me; and two, when will he come out of the closet?     Not male bashing? Unreal.    I have much work to do to save my marriage as my wife was obviously not happy enough to purchase this waste of paper and ink. I will print off these reviews and give it to her - she seems to be taking this work of fiction to heart, underlining passages and starring as well.

Tennessee Unionist regiments in general haven't been the focus of a lot of regimental histories, and West Tennessee units are even less studied than those from East Tennessee.<br />Not surprisingly, information seems to be somewhat limited on the 6th TN. There just isn't a lot of detail on the regiment and many of its actions. I suspect this is mostly due to a lack of available accounts rather than any failure of the author regarding research. This is a good account of the regiment's actions, but one is left wanting more information. Still, some hitherto little studied actions in West Tennessee receive what attention they can. For what appears to be a self published books, the editing and production values are pretty good, although some errors creep in. With the above in mind, this is a worthwhile history of an obscure unit, necessarily limited in its detail.","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

I felt that none of the pages made any sense to me and even seemed slightly boring.  But because I liked the premise of the book and what it involved- a heartwarming story about coming home and appreciating the people and the stuff that you left behind- I decided to keep on treking and see what the book was all about.  Not only that, I felt that the book, if I gave it a chance, would empathize, in a way, with my unfortunate set of circumstances- living back home with the parents in my 30s due to change of careers like the heroine in the story, Meridith McKay.<br /><br />Luckily, mainly because I'm a die-hard romantic at heart, I felt my full-blown interest grow because of the introduction of Meridith's hearthrob into the story, hottie Scott Sheridan, who also used to be in high school with Meridith.  After that, I could hardly put the book down, so intent as I was on finishing the book and seeing what new revelations each page brought.<br /><br />Other issues that Meridith was suffering from- the issues with her overbearing parents (which I could totally identify with); the lack of closeness with her sister, Hope, who was 6 years younger than her; the lack of closeness with her brother who she used to be close to in high school like a twin until he started dating an ex-friend of hers, Jeannie; and the clashes with Jeannie herself who wanted to become friends with Meridith again after years adrift.  A lot of these issues are sad but not unusual for any normal family and between friends.  It all becomes very heartwarming in the end because, not only does Meridith examines herself and her failed relationships, taking partial responsibility for them, but also mends and fixes any broken fences that there were between family and friends.  In addition, the burgening relationship between her and Scott becomes very interesting and hot, when they become both friends and lovers (different from when they were in high school).<br /><br />If you haven't read this book, I highly recommend that you get a copy ASAP, especially if you can identify like me, with the usual family issues that crop up when you go home to visit or eventually return home to live, like Meridith, whether it's for a short time or a long time.  Returning home is never easy.  Take it from me.  This book has a lot of humor in it, so you won't ever get bored.  It does starts kind of slow but as you read on further, you'll get right into the action.

Without denigrating other religious traditions, Hazen skillfully provides a thoughtful critique that permits one to reason his or her way among the various competing religious traditions.

But I bought this novel because of the terrific reviews, and I was curious to read what was on the mind of the author these days.  I'm glad I did.  This is a fairly sophisticated time-travel story, well written, romantic in parts, and a page turner.  (You will have to turn many pages:  it's king-sized, over 800 pages.)  King's imagination is superb; that's what keeps you reading.  The protagonist must go from 2007 to 11/22/63 and kill Lee Harvey Oswald so that President Kennedy lives.  The assumption is that if Oswald is killed and Kennedy lives there will be no Vietnam War, and thus the lives of many American soldiers will be saved.  Read the book to test this assumption.

The reason that I waver on the stars is because for me, as a beginner, this is a difficult book. For me, it is a 3 or maybe a 2-star book but for many people it will be more of a 4 star book, so I put that ranking on it so that people will read more about it and decide for themselves.     On the back is says for \\""novice\\"" players and it looked very readable, so I bought it.  The problem is that there are a lot of words in here that are not clear to me. For instance, \\""inside straight\\"" (don't laugh, experienced players). There is a glossary but it does not include these terms.     On the positive side, I have been playing Hold'em Poker on my Blackberry (King, Magmic Games) and immediately went from losing almost every game to winning.  This was based on what I was able to understand from the book and Wikipedia. I'm not a dumb person, having a graduate degree in the sciences and having taken math through advanced differential equations in college. However, the jargon floored me. If the editors would have somewhat who knows nothing about poker read this book and find all the words they don't understand, explain them, and put them in the glossary, that would make this book more accessible to the newbie.      However, if you are not a true beginner, but you understand phrases such as \\""inside straight\\"", \\""turn bet\\"", \\""flush draw\\"", \\""take off a single card\\"", then you will probably get enough out of this book to justify an investment, especially if you ever want to play live Hold'em.     There are many interesting topics in the book related to things that one would never think about, such as, \\""Which is the best seat at the table?\\""  or \\""How should one position oneself in relationship to loose or aggressive players?\\"".  Also, what type of image do you want to establish for yourself among other players? Many of these hints seem logical and are likely to be helpful in real-life situations.","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

I appreciated the thorough research included in this book about the histories or sororities, the national organizations, and how traditionally Black sororities differ.  One caution: I've talked about this book with several people I know who are in sororities themselves.

However what he finds on the planet Regilence is more than he had bargained for.  It's a planet of patriarchal military homo power-couples, including King Steven and his male \\""consort,\\"" Raleigh who have five handsome and somewhat rowdy sons.  Captain Hawkins takes a shine to one, a very talented artist named Aiden, but the Captain doesn't know whether he's ready to become a family man and try to \\""fit in\\"" to this planet and it's somewhat idiosynchratic customs and mores (and how can he give up his beloved ship and the life he has made there?)<br /><br />Add a bunch of fun and likable characters, including the sons and the King and his \\""Consort\\"" as well as the wonderfully written character of Trouble; mystery, action, suspense, and enough romance to melt the most frozen heart, and you get a novel that is a joy to read, possibly more than once.<br /><br />There are enough loose ends that there could be a second book, and I would rush out to buy it, should it become available.

I've enjoyed a few other Murakamis and initially I found this to be of his usual pleasing style, with added mystery and intrigue. I would probably have given it four stars.<br /><br />But once it moves into the supernatural, not only does the story become bizarre and unappealing, the whole rhythm, plotting, and sense of the novel seems to just fall apart. I was convinced it must have been written for a daily newspaper serialisation, probably an immature earlier work, that had just been edited into a single novel by greedy publishers, but no, it is apparently his magnu opus. I really think it must be some sort of joke of his, trying to find what utter rubbish he can produce before he gets called out. I am not even convinced he wrote it himself. It is more like a piece of amateurish fan fiction.<br /><br />There are so many weak points, I don't really know where to start. Lots of repetition. Pointless episodes. Things presented as inevitable logic, but in reallity totally random.<br /><br />The Sakigake are supposed to be a powerful, ruthless and unforgiving organisation, with their web infiltrating the whole of Tokyo, so that Aomame will have to go into hiding and change her identity to evade them, but their crack team consists of two thugs and a private detective. The detective makes progress by making wild assumptions which turn out as lucky guesses, but are presented as if they were some form of infallible logic. It is confusing why Aomame is even trying to evade them, as she seems to have a suicide wish.<br /><br />The little people are also supposed to have terrifying powers, including mind-reading, weather control, cloning, and presumably power over life and death, but they turn out to be a bit irrelevant as well, and it is not even really clear what they are actually upset about, or to be frank, why they were mentioned in the novel at all.<br /><br />The episode with Aomame treating the Leader is a bit like a scene from a James Bond movie, where he reveals half the plot in a couple of paragraphs.<br /><br />Even trivial little episodes seem illogical. The cab driver is argumentative about taking Aomame's preferred route, despite the fact she is waiving 50 quid in his face. She has to offerh im another 50 quid just to change lanes. But then after he has seen her prancing about on the motorway waiving her pistol, he suddenly meekly takes her back into his cab and on with the rest of her journey.<br /><br />The only good thing about the book is, you don't have to bother paying attention to the plot development or wondering why character behave in certain ways.

The title carries a double meaning:  Just how married do you want to be to your spouse?  And just how married do you want to be to Christ?  This was an amazing look at marriage, presented clearly as a covenant created by God to enable us to work out our growth as Christians, as well as truly becoming One with our spouse for a victorious marriage.  The insights of being open and searching our souls for hidden attitudes and defenses  explains how the work of growing closer in our marriage can draw us closer to God.     The honest examples of struggle in understanding our spouse is encouraging to us at every stage of marriage, whether newlywed or veteran.   We have been encouraged to open ourselves to greater intimacy and understanding of each other, as we realize there is always more ways we can draw closer to becoming One.   Being in community with other believers was shown to be an essential part of  the growth process.

I went ahead a bought the collector's edition because I really wanted to see the book in the form that she intended it to be.  However, I so wanted to read the tales that I could not wait until the CE arrived from Amazon.  So I went out and bought the standard edition as well.      I just compared to two editions and found some unexpected differences.  Beyond the metal corners and the reprint of Rowling's handwritten introduction, found only in the collector's edition, the standard edition does not have all of Rowling's illustrations!  For instance, in The Wizard and the Hopping Pot, the illustrations of the \\""pot, slipper and note,\\"" (page 27 of CE), as well as the \\""wizard (son) and women with the baby,\\"" (pg. 32) are missing.  The illustration of the \\""warlock courting the maiden\\"" (pg. 90) in The Warlock Hairy Heart -  a piece that I thought was particularly beautiful - is nowhere to be found in the standard edition either.  So, if you are still debating whether you should spend the money on the CE, you may want consider how important the illustrations are to you.      BTW, while I understand that certain sacrifices had to made for the standard edition, I don't think it was really fair to the standard edition buyers to remove actual material from Rowling's work - even if they were just the illustrations. . . . Yeah, I know the Editors, nor Rowling, asked for my opinion, but I thought I would give it anyway.  Take it for what it is worth.","2008-12-14","2008","Books"

Dann liegen Sie auch gar nicht so falsch, denn bei den eben erw&auml;hnten Personen handelt es sich tats&auml;chlich um die bekannten Figuren aus der Literatur, die in Form eines amerikanischen Superheldenteams gegen ihre ebenso literarischen B&ouml;sewichte antreten, denn im Universum der Liga geben sich Figuren aus den Abenteuerromanen gemeinsam mit Gestalten aus den Pulp-Heften gegenseitig die Klinke in die Hand, was bedeutet dass die gro&szlig;en Alten eines H.P. Lovecrafts ebenso lebendig sind wie das sagenumwobene Land Liliput aus den Reisen des Lemuel Gullivers und oder die eben schon erw&auml;hnte Nautilus so gut funktioniert wie in den Romanen von Jules Vernes beschrieben.<br /><br />Es ist ein d&uuml;steres Szenario, in die uns der Autor Alan Moore und Zeichner Kevin O'Neil entf&uuml;hren, was schon bei den Hauptfiguren anf&auml;ngt. Alan Quartermain ist zu Beginn nur ein opiums&uuml;chtiger Greis, K&auml;pt'n Nemo ein Misanthrop reinsten Wassers, Mister Hyde eine rei&szlig;ende Bestie und der Unsichtbare ein vor sich hin kichernder M&ouml;rder und Vergewaltiger und auch Miss Murray scheint gewisse Geheimnisse mit sich rumzutragen.<br /><br />Man merkt dem Heft an dass die ersten sechs Ausgaben mehr einer spontanen Anwandlung denn klarer &Uuml;berlegung zu Grunde legen. Zwar wird in fast jeder Seite auf alle m&ouml;glichen Geschichten der englischen Literatur Bezug genommen doch die eigentliche Geschichte ist eher geradlinig, daf&uuml;r recht witzig und Action geladen. Trotzdem fehlt ihr die Tiefe des zweiten Bandes Krieg der Welten\\"" oder die enorme Detailverliebtheit und verr&uuml;ckte Experimentierfreude eines Black Dossiers. Nichtsdestotrotz ist auch die erste Gesamtausgabe der Liga ein sehr guter Comic, der vor allem noch einige geschmackvolle Extras enth&auml;lt.<br /><br />Eines davon ist die von Alan Moore verfasste und Kevin O'Neil illustrierte Geschichte \\""Alan und der geteilte Schleier\\"" die auf ihre Art als Vorgeschichte zum Comic z&auml;hlen k&ouml;nnte. In sechs Kapiteln wird von Alan Quartermains Reise auf eine andere Ebene im Stile eines Fortsetzungsromans eine spannende Geschichte erz&auml;hlt, in der Moore auch sein K&ouml;nnen abseits des Comicmarkts unter Beweis stellt und erneut v&ouml;llig verschiedene Geschichten und Ideen von Wells, Lovecraft und Edgar Rice Burroughs zu einem grandiosen Ganzen zusammenf&uuml;hrt. Da die Geschichte wie gesagt als Fortsetzungsgeschichte konzipiert wurde, kann man sie auch eine Weile liegen lassen und dann im letzten Kapitel wieder einsteigen, da man problemlos an die Hand genommen wird.<br /><br />Was bleibt noch zu sagen?<br /><br />Neben der Geschichte werden noch einige satirische Elemente, wie einige abstruse Erfindungen oder die fiktiven und hirnrissigen Biographien der beiden Macher hinzugef&uuml;gt. &Uuml;berhaupt ist der Stil des Heftes so gehalten dass man ihn f&uuml;r einen Teil der alten Literatur halten k&ouml;nnte.<br /><br />Betrachtet man den Umstand, dass der erste Teil heute schon als moderner Klassiker gilt und n&auml;chstes Jahr sein zehnj&auml;hriges feiert, k&ouml;nnte man schon eine gewisse Ironie dahinter sehen.<br /><br />Fazit: Ein guter Auftakt, einer sich fortentwickelnden und mit ihren Alter reifenden Comicserie der neueren Zeit, ein Muss f&uuml;r alle Moorefans und Freunde der Literatur.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

While the sex, drugs, and teen angst may all seem a little cliché, Chbosky does an amazing job of realistically portraying high school situations in a uniquely hilarious way through the protagonist Charlie. The story is told through Charlie's devastating letters to whom the reader may not know he is writing. The theme woven through Charlie's letters is his constant struggle between passivity and passion. Letter by letter the reader is drawn into Charlie's fanatical world only to be in awe at the story's end.     The story begins with the start of Charlie's freshman year in high school where he is prone to depression, shy, introverted, and \\""on the fringes of life\\"" after dealing with the losses of a friend and his Aunt Helen. He is a wallflower, someone intelligent beyond his years but socially awkward. Some of the few people to notice Charlie's intelligence are his English teacher and newfound senior friends Sam and Patrick. With their help Charlie comes to terms with life and learns to interact. Letter by letter the plot unfolds as Charlie learns to deal with almost every tough issue know to a teen. Chbosky handles these tragic issues so well that they come off as realistic rather than over-the-top. This realism is why I believe The Perks of Being a Wallflower is such a special book.    Chbosky further develops the theme of Charlie's struggle between passivity and passion through the constant pressures he must face in his freshman year in high school. Whether it is dances, first dates, drugs, sexuality, or the Rocky Horror Picture Show, Charlie is relentlessly barraged with the task of eliminating his social awkwardness. Chbosky's realistic style leaves an impact on the reader by placing him or her into Charlie's world. There the reader gets an up close and personal view of each developing situation and becomes attached to the ups and downs associated with Charlie's life. Charlie's relationship with his teacher Bill also parallels one of the major themes of the novel. This theme is the clash between young adult and adult culture. While Charlie is trying to identify himself as a man, he continuously finds himself running away from his life and reverting back to a childlike state. Bill acts as an intermediate force between these clashing worlds and tries to get Charlie to lead a normal high school life and further provide an identity for Charlie. Bill helps Charlie get his mind off the things Charlie is running away from through books and essay writing.    In my opinion, Perks of Being a Wallflower is an amazing book that should be read by all high school students. Chbosky offers humor, drama, and a unique quality to the story that keeps the reader entertained with each turning page. The novel is truly an entertaining read and I would recommend it to anyone who has experienced the highs and lows of high school.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

An elitist, ego-centric, ethno-centric, uncompassionate, un-empathetic, and a narrow-boxed view of things (seemingly based in the school of Scientology) breakdown of procrastination is what you get. I understand that this book is meant to be a 'no-excuses' book camp for the mind. Motivation however does not have to be belittling. Pressfield manages to dispel psychology and modern medicine and the fact that some people have real problems. Moreover; he not only mocks the idea of socio-economic status being a real influence in procrastination and where life leads us; but he goes as far as to mock the culture(s) that may live within. Negatively referring to 'RAP' music and using the term 'Homies' in a discerning tone; as if an affluent male born in 1943 is such an expert to comment on these things.

It is not by any means ground-breaking fantasy, however. The book is the first in a projected trilogy, and tells the story of an extraordinarily precocious boy whose family is killed and then goes out to seek the wrongdoers. Pretty standard. Any fan of fantasy knows, though, that plot is only one small part of the magic. Most of the artistry lies in characters and in world-building.    The Name of the Wind is told mainly in the first person, which is a departure from the norm for the genre. Through this narrative format, we learn a great deal about the main character, Kvothe- the way his mind works, his feelings and his reasoning- but we get very little insight into the other characters. I like the first person narrative as future-Kvothe seems to be a pretty fascinating person. However, teenage-Kvothe is the main character in the story, and he can get a bit tiring. Hopefully he does some quick maturing in the next couple of books. It wasn't that he was unlikable at all. He was just such a teenager- sometimes so cocky and arrogant and rude for no purpose, and sometimes so completely the opposite that you'd think he was a different person. But it says a lot about Rothfuss that he captured the age of his character so well!    The world-building aspect of the novel is where it fell just a little short for me, and I think this is due to the first-person narrative. We are limited to knowing only what Kvothe knows and sees and hears, and so we have no real scope of how large the world he lives in is or who the major players in it are. I only know what Kvothe decides to tell me. This can be extremely frustrating, but it also means that there may be many more interesting stories and folklore shared in the coming books- I hope so! What I have seen and heard of Kvothe's world is intriguing so far, but it is impossible to put together any of the parts into a cohesive structure. Meaning- I read the story and was interested by it, but Iam not entirely certain that I know what it is even about.    That said, I'm very happy to hear that the next installment in the series will be published in April so that I can continue learning about Kvothe and his world and his friends. I have a feeling the series will be one that holds my interest while I read it, though I am not quite sure if it is destined for my keeper shelf.    **A small but real annoyance with this book is that there are several typos.  I have a third edition of the Daw hardcover and there were many errors in it, which I found annoying and unnecessary.  I hope Daw cleans them up.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

In the book, the author tells you that even if someone tells you that you look great today, don't take it personal because they don't mean it. Their words are a manifestation of themselves. I disagree with this and most psychologists and trained mental health professionals do, as well. There is power in the word, yes, but it is powerful to give and receive.

Longtemps, vraisemblablement. Je ne voudrais pas avoir l'air de râler, mais sérieusement, j'aimerais bien connaître la suite. Éventuellement, si Christopher veut m'envoyer son manuscrit au fur et à mesure de l'écriture, je suis preneuse. Si c'est parfois un schéma gagant, on pense évidemment tous à Harry Potter, je sais qu'il y a certaines de ces séries que j'ai abandonné, comme The Dark Tower, de Stephen King. Pour être franche, si j'ai attendu que Brisingr soit paru avant de lire les deux premiers, c'est bien pour minimiser l'attente. Non, je ne suis pas patiente, c'est vrai !    Je suis très contente de ce livre, qui reprend les ingrédients gagnants de \\""Eldest\\"", sans la lenteur que je lui avais parfois trouvé. Eragon et Saphira mûrissent, et c'est bon de les voir s'épanouir dans leur relation... et auprès de ceux qu'ils aiment. Même si bien sûr, les moments de félicité sont rares... tant que Galbatorix sera vivant, Eragon et Saphira ne seront jamais en paix. Les batailles sont épiques, les sentiments exacerbés, c'est parfois difficile pour nos héros de prendre les bonnes décisions, surtout envers et contre tous, mais ils suivent le chemin dicté par leur coeur et leur bon sens.     Malgré les similitudes avec les aventures écrites par J.K Rowling, J.R.R Tolkien ou même George Lucas, sans compter une allusion au fameux Docteur Who... ce troisième tome est riche en révélations, que je n'avais pas toutes vues venir (OK, presque aucune.) Le Varden se bat plus que jamais contre les forces de Galbatorix, les Elfes également, les Nains sont à l'aube d'une guerre civile... et nos héros, Eragon et Saphira, sont toujours épaulés par Roran, devenu un farouche guerrier, la belle Elfe Arya qui baisse parfois sa garde, et d'autres seconds rôles que je ne révèlerais pas pour ne pas gâcher le suspense... Tous se posent des questions sur le bien fondé de la guerre, sauf peut être Saphira, qui joue avec ses ennemis comme un chat avec un souris. Mais définitivement, on ne peut guère lui reprocher. D'ailleurs, on ne peut rien retenir contre Saphira :)","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

The five tales are definitely simple, if not simple-minded, and far from what could be thought about and expected from modern tales, or even tales in the tradition of thousands of years of story telling in the whole humanity. The author avoided the plain rewriting of tales, except the last one, the story of the three brothers, that is obvious, but that's just the point I would like to make: apparently traditional tales, all over the world, contain some simple structural elements that seem to be universal in story telling, part of a universal creative mind, and J.L. Rowling misses that point completely because her tales seem to be out of line of anything at all. And I have to admit these tales have little logic. Babbitty Rabbitty is based on the fact that witches can't do anything against a bunch of dogs, and at the same time one old witch alone can evade both detection and then the dogs when finally detected. And I won't speak of the poor youngest brother who lived all his life under Death's invisibility cloak: he must not have taken a shower very often. The Warlock story is absolutely gross and even terrible in the etymological meaning: it definitely evokes terror, it definitely terrifies people, or maybe only horrifies them. It sounds like some old Christian martyrdom tale. And the worst and most irritating part is the fact that J.K. Rowling adds Dumbledore's commentary and notes after each tale, as if the modern audience could not think all by itself, as if we were looking for a pedagogical text-book. In other words, J.K. Rowling could have been better inspired.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

The guy is a writing machine and his work touches every era of American history. However, Traitor to His Class resolves the issue. Not only is it the best biography of FDR, it is a better history of the depression and WWII than many acclaimed books in those fields. Some historians can't help but treat each event separately; Brands' treatment has a wholistic feel that never lets you forget the urgency of the sick economy or the rapacity of the Axis. The emphasis he imparts to various episodes strike me as both well measured and well said. There are no new insights, but there are observations from characters not usually quoted and excerpts from FDR speeches rarely heard.    This book is especially revealing at this point in time. As I write, the economy is retracting, a depression is feared and the Bush administration is fumbling its recessitation. Much of the current political commentary is a rehash from Herbert Hoover's time. Brands' book makes you realize how far starboard this nation has drifted in the last 40 years and how little we have learned from the past.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

One of my first conversations with John was during the winter of 2005-06; I was shoveling my driveway, with my son (just a few months old, but bundled up) in a front carrier.  John came rushing over with a shovel, and helped me finish clearing my driveway.  He said, \\""I couldn't let a woman with a baby shovel by herself.\\""  He told me he had Parkinson's Disease, and I told him I was all-too familiar with the symptoms (someone close to me had the disease as well).<br /><br />What a great first impression!  Here's a guy who has every right to be unhappy with his situation, but he's one of the most positive people I now know.  It's taken some time to get to know John: loves his cigars, has one of the most beautiful gardens I have ever seen (I told him he should write about that too), and helps his neighbors year round...and that's just the tip of the iceberg.<br /><br />Living in the same town means I get to read articles in the local newspaper written by John, and he's also shared some of his poetry with me.  Everything he writes is inspirational.  For this reason, John reminds me of a viking.  He makes the best out of what he's dealt, he doesn't feel sorry for himself, and he loves a good laugh -- even if it's at himself.<br /><br />If you know someone who is living with Parkinson's, or has recently been diagnosed --or even someone who would like to know what it's like living with the disease, then buy this book.  Most people only think of the symptoms, and forget to consider how a person's life is affected.  This book will give you a new perspective -- a postive one.<br /><br />And...I don't think John would mind if I recommend [[ASIN:1893273091 Perelman's Pocket Cyclopedia of Cigars 2008 edition]].","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

Hundreds of times I've felt the heavy oppression of motionless air, watched greenish-black clouds pile up on the horizon, and known that something terrible, beyond my control, was developing. Vienna Dolorosa levied the same sense of foreboding.<br /><br />The story takes place in a single day in 1938, at various locations in Vienna on the last day before the Nazi takeover.  The majority of the action occurs in the Hotel Redl, a down-at-heels hotel saved from complete failure by the advent of an intriguing, intelligent creature named Friska Bielinska. But Friska is not quite what she appears to be, and neither is the Hotel Redl. The Redl has tourist rooms but it also has a secret: it's a brothel for men who like boys dressed as girls.<br /><br />The story is told through the denizens of the hotel/brothel. These people include a brown-shirted Nazi official who becomes the victim of the most hideously vicious attack you will ever read, something for which I was as unprepared as he was. There is a street urchin named Petya who is a survivor of poverty and abuse, who sells himself to live. Petya is clever, tough, and surprisingly sweet. Another is a buxom hotel maid who likes women though she delights in teasing men. Others are: the owner of the hotel, an aging dandy, and a Jewish tourist couple. Most of all there is Friska.<br /><br />Friska is slim, attractive, and feminine in her manners and attire. Adversity in her own life has made her compassionate, someone who cares about people, whether they are customers or her boy/girls. And she is a he. Friska is referred to throughout as \\""she\\"" because, as we would say today, she identifies as a woman. If the story had been set in the 21st century instead of 1938 I suspect the author would have made her transgendered instead of a transvestite.<br /><br />Most of the action is appallingly brutal, and much of it is carried out either by Nazis or with the approval of Nazi officials, including the arrest and horrific punishment of one of their own caught with another man. The villains are monstrous but identifiably human--the policemen carrying out punishments, the SS, the soldiers, the citizens who turn upon anyone who is or appears to be different, or who simply has angered them for some reason. The major players are complex, especially the noble-spirited Friska, and Petya, whom you want to rescue and protect.<br /><br />Vienna Dolorosa has been denounced as pornographic, but pornography is intended to titillate and arouse; anybody who gets aroused by the events in Vienna Dolorosa has a serious problem. It's true there is an overwhelming amount of graphic sex and graphic violence of every description but each incident builds the story brick by horrifying brick. It is said that truth is in the eye of the beholder; the author puts faces on the faceless victims of violence and forces you to behold. There are no funny, fat, stupid Sgt. Schultzes among Dementiuk's Nazis, and no happy endings.<br /><br />The narration is very good, written with a wonderful eye for detail. Sometimes it is intrusive and takes the reader out of the moment (on the other hand, perhaps that is a kindness!)  However, except for the intrusiveness, I find the historic narration to be a clear and passionate commentary on one momentous 24-hour period and what led to it.<br /><br />I have only a few quibbles, which are as follow.<br /><br />The characters of the incestuous father and pregnant teenage daughter are extraneous. They didn't really add anything to the story that I could see, and they clogged an already large cast.<br /><br />Two situations struck a jarring chord. The gang-raped woman has orgasms with each rapist and her reaction and movements afterward are unrealistic. The same applies to the young girl who gives birth. Though the birth and death of her baby are dreadful in its graphicness, the follow-up is unrealistic and unconvincing. Rape is traumatic, physically and mentally. Childbirth is painful for grown women, let alone a simpleminded young girl who doesn't understand what is happening. Yet other than superficially, neither the young woman who was raped nor the victimized girl seem to be much affected once it's over.<br /><br />I also feel that Kurt's ultimate fate, about halfway through the story, goes way over the line of gratuitous violence. In my opinion the horror could have been effectively stopped with the surgical scene, which was sickening enough. The story didn't need the additional assault, which stopped my reading for several days. (I won't detail more than that because I don't want to create a spoiler.)<br /><br />But all that aside, it is a truly remarkable book. I recommend Vienna Dolorosa with the following caveats. DON'T read this book if you have a weak stomach, are faint of heart, or are offended by \\""alternate lifestyles\\"". DON'T read it if you are looking for escapism because there is no escape in this book, not for the characters and not for the reader. On the other hand, if you can read historical accounts of hatred, genocide, and atrocities, if you want to read an extremely disturbing but unforgettable book, you should read Vienna Dolorosa.

Which isn't to say that it's useless, or that the advice (what there is of it) isn't good. I just felt that there was far more cheerleading than guidance.<br /><br />As others have noted, there are three components to \\""The Truth About You.\\"" The first is a DVD in which author Marcus Buckingham stares piercingly into the camera and evangelizes about finding and playing to your strengths. As he enthuses, we see glimpses of a story about a schoolkid who played trombone, but felt that his calling was really to tump-tump-tump on a tympani. Uh, okay. He followed his dream and ended up thudding in the school orchestra. Which is fine, but as a middle-aged guy looking at these materials for career inspiration, I was underwhelmed.<br /><br />The second component is a book (or more accurately, a booklet) with more motivational arm waving, as well as some practical (even useful) exercises for determining your strengths. Incidentally, according to Buckingham your strengths are not necessarily what you're good at, but are what you really enjoy doing. There's some validity to this...but it doesn't necessarily follow that you're going to achieve much success doing things you aren't especially good at (though in fairness, if you measure success by personal satisfaction, maybe you WILL consider yourself more successful).<br /><br />Part of Buckingham's hypothesis is that employers and team members will recognize and eventually appreciate the impassioned performance that comes from concentrating on your strengths, and that you'll be rewarded because performance is the most important thing in the workplace. Sadly, this hasn't been my experience, and may not be yours. Far too often, people rise professionally not because of skill or competence, but because of their Machiavellian skills or the inability of supervisors to even know good work when they see it (let alone those supervisors who are threatened by excellence, so try to surround themselves with people who don't make THEM look bad).<br /><br />The third component of this book/package is a little notepad that you can carry around for a week, jotting down the things you do that make you feel empowered, and the things that make you feel trapped or weakened. This isn't a bad idea - but really, did half the package need to be designed as a holder for a 3 x 5 notepad?<br /><br />All in all, I was hoping for more insight and less evangelical zeal (imagine Anthony Robbins on waaaaay too much coffee). Again, there IS some good material here if you work the exercises...just less than I'd hoped for.<br /><br />On a side note, whoever did the art design on \\""The Truth About You\\"" made a horrible choice when deciding to use big bar codes as the predominant design element throughout a book on discovering your individuality.

Since then, many lives have been saved by this delicate and skilled procedure. It remains dangerous, and patients risk infection and rejection if they survive the operation itself. When Ryan Perry, just 34 years old, undergoes the transplant, he is prepared for the worst. But a year later he is in good health. Then mysterious and creepy gifts begin to appear, bringing back memories of the year leading up to the surgery. He knows it is all connected: his break-up with his girlfriend, the transplant, the gifts left for him by a threatening entity. But how?    YOUR HEART BELONGS TO ME, Dean Koontz's latest thriller, is Ryan's story.    Ryan is a self-made success; having made millions in the high-tech industry, he is confident and content. He has a beautiful and smart girlfriend, work he finds interesting, a California mansion, and whole days free to surf and play. Yet all is not completely well. Samantha won't marry him and won't really tell him why. There are things about herself, especially the death of her twin sister, that she keeps from him, and he wonders why she doesn't trust him. He begins to have panic attacks, and they quickly turn into debilitating episodes of physical pain. After he finds out he has a heart condition, he decides to find the best doctors money can buy. As he approaches the transplant surgery that will save his life, Samantha pulls away from him and strange things begin to happen. Paranoid and scared, Ryan uses his financial resources to try to find answers. But it is only later, after Samantha is gone and he has a new heart, that Ryan can really get the answers he was seeking.    Part supernatural thriller, part medical mystery, part love story and part moralistic tale, YOUR HEART BELONGS TO ME is an interesting novel about greed, love, anger, loss and redemption. When Koontz tells readers that \\""Ryan Perry did not know something in him was broken\\"" it is soon obvious that it is not just hisheart to which he is referring. Ryan, like many of the characters in the book, is a deeply wounded individual who must come to terms not only with the decisions he has made, but also with things beyond his control. They each may choose art or violence, perversion or service, but in the end they are all grappling with nothing less than the meaning of a life well lived and a death not in vain. Ryan is helped along the way, but a series of individuals who come into his life to bring him guidance and move him towards the enlightenment will make him far healthier than any medical procedure can.    Ryan Perry is not a very likable character. In fact he is a bit of a spoiled brat, with a domestic staff to cook his meals, drive him around and even turn down his bed sheets at night. Koontz, however, wants to prove that there is goodness in even such a self-centered and shallow man. While the plot veers wildly a few times, readers --- if willing to look past the undeveloped ghostly tangent --- will find much to enjoy.    YOUR HEART BELONGS TO ME lacks the lightness and humor of the early Odd Thomas novels, but is a far better book than his last, THE DARKEST EVENING OF THE YEAR, with plenty of the scary and spine-tingling moments that has made Koontz a bestselling author.    --- Reviewed by Sarah Rachel Egelman","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

John Green had had yet to disappoint me, so I was very excited to read this book. Quentin Jacobsen, the main character, is very easy to relate to, particularly involving his longtime love for his next door neighbor, Margo Roth Spiegelman. One night, when Margo unexpectedly pops into the window of Quentin's life, literally, she takes him on the greatest adventure of his average life. The next morning, Margo is missing from school--and all of the mornings following that one. This being a typical stunt of Margo's, her parents hardly bat an eye; at this point, they are just annoyed at the immaturity and recklessness that is their daughter. Quentin, on the other hand, seeks out clues that he believes were left directly for him by Margo in hopes that he can figure out where on earth she is, and be her knight in shining armor. He succeeds in this, but comes to find out that Margo is not quite the girl that he dreamed her up to be. This is the realization that I can relate to the most. I have definitely conjured up amazing, perfect people with my imagination, and come to find out that they are only human. It is easy to convince yourself that someone is exactly who you want them to be, and it often leads to disappointment in the end. Although the ending of this book was unsatisfying, I still gave it a 5 star rating because the incredible storyline and writing style had me hooked, as usual with Green. All in all, I highly recommend this compelling novel.","2015-08-14","2015","Books"

The toolkit has three parts; an enhanced DVD, an interactive book, and a ReMemo pad.  The goal of this toolkit is to create a more interactive experience for the reader.  It also provides a chance for the reader to receive the same message/ideas in multiple formats.  Finally, this toolkit format leaves the reader without an excuse to not learning what her strengths and weaknesses are and apply that knowledge to her job.    I enjoyed the video format, a mixture of Buckingham speaking into the camera and footage of a boy finding his strengths, and found it easy to connect with the ideas.  If you pay attention to the video, you'll notice that most of the thoughts are found throughout the book.  This repetition helped me process the connection between what he was saying and my own personal situation.  The concepts are fairly simple, so the book is easy to follow (which makes it a pretty quick read).     Overall, The Truth About You is a good resource for anyone who is not satisfied with her current job situation or feels like there is a better way to use her talents.  The biggest complaint with this toolkit, along with most other business books, is the price ($30), which seems high to me.  If you can afford the cost or can get a copy from a friend, it is worth your time to go through this well-developed toolkit.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

The narrator is remarkably easy to identify with, and her love of learning and yearning to read is tangible. Her narrative reminds us what a privilege it is just to be able to read. The author has to bend over backwards to justify how a slave can safely keep a diary, when the very idea of such a thing is illegal, but we can forgive the somewhat absurd lengths this issue reaches, in order to justify having this wonderful fictional narrative.<br /><br />Since this is a novel about slavery, there is some potentially disturbing material here, including a beating that leaves the slave dead after several days of serious illness. The plantation owner's child dies in an unforeseen accident which may be disturbing to young children. And both the master and mistress are quite childish and cruel, with the master accusing the long-time cook of the household of being likely to poison him to death after the master murders the cook's husband.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

This book is designed to be a \\""textbook\\"" for the AP Calculus AB/BC exams. I think in that respect it succeeds immensely!<br /><br />My teacher chose this text for our AP Calculus AB class and found it a delight to work with. The concepts were explained clearly, there were enough example problems to get the point across. I did find an occasional \\""skipped\\"" step which would basically force me to try to fill in the gap, but hey, that helps get the calculus juices flowing, right?<br /><br />The problems in the book -- which are the cornerstone of any textbook -- are really well designed for what an AP Calculus student should be able to do. There are several kinds of problems. The \\""quick reviews\\"" are useful for beginning of class warmups (you know, 10 minutes to drill the basics) and the actual problems can vary from easy to challenging (but all within the scope of AP difficulty).<br /><br />So if you're an AP Calc teacher looking for a class text or a student who wants to self study calculus specifically for the AP exam, then this is, by all means, the text to use.

This is a suave, British, tongue in character, so much more like The Saint than the violent Connery portrayal. (Once Timothy Dalton took over, good bye to Bond as depicted by Ian Fleming.) The current one, as NY Times critic described him, is sad. Yes, I feel sad, for the early Bond books were great. When Roger stepped in Live and Let Die (the second Bond), the series got a new lease of life. Those movies made money and Roger is not ashamed to state that he got a percentage.   Like his characters, the book is full of charm and fun. A sense of self deprecation that is rarely seen in successful actors is here: like saying that he was an actor because his passport said so (before his first major 'acting' role in the Man Who Haunted Himself.  It is a fast moving book, almost like it has been edited like a movie. The colloquial curses do detract, one doesn't expect that from Sir Roger, CBE. But it does not seriously damage the flow of the book. There are a parade of British and American actors that flit through the book, some who acted with him, such as Bernie Schwartz, I beg your pardon, Tony Curtis. He provides one the most hilarious line in the book, shouting to Walter Mathau in Hollywood after they were both in the same acting school, that he had actually conquered Hollywood, 'I slept with Yvonne De Carlo' except he does not use the word sleep.  There is a poignant piece when he visits a dying David Niven that displeased his wife.  His work in UNICEF, to which he was introduced by the great Audrey Hepburn, is narrated with pride. Why not, that part of his life gave brought him the CBE and the Sir.  The reader will be struck by one omission in this otherwise pretty open autobiography is the dismissal of the mother of his 3 children, Luisa, in one sentence. The time had come to separate. And the next sentence he is happy beyond words with new girl friend. Well those things happen. But one pauses and reflects. He is now over eighty and this book is well worth reading. Not the life of a great actor but one who had fun in his life and evidently that enjoyment spills over in this slight but attractive book.  By the way, the last line in the book is hilarious follows a puzzling long list of physicians who had treated him.  Like the Saint.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

People looked, but they never saw.\\"" I had recently read newspapers accounts of homeowners discovering that someone had lived in their home unbeknownst to them for quite some time, and of course, a case in Japan, where a similar incident happened, made international headlines. TL Hines crossed the line of complete fiction to plant a little niggle of doubt in my mind.<br /> While it's old but still fun to speculate on secret government agencies, it's more fun to wonder if there really are people out there who live completely under the radar. How long and under what circumstances can a person survive with the most tenuous ties to society? Lucas's fantasy biographies for the people he spied on touched me, because I tend to something similar.  The real question is how Lucas achieves his elusive goal of unraveling the mystery of his identity. What kind of a person is he? Is he as evil as other people who play the same kind of game he does, spying on the lives of the unwary? Or does he have a redeeming quality yet untapped?<br /> A mysterious annoying refrain and nightmares are the only ties Lucas has to a past that is unaccountably blank. When Lucas reaches out to meet another person who has similar interests to his, his carefully built anonymity crumbles. Through circumstances over which he has no control, he is drawn into the world of double agents, homeland security, kidnapping and brainwashing.<br /> Although the book is categorized \\""Christian\\"" I am dismayed by the trend of bigger publishers of inspirational material to play the crossover game. I would not call The Unseen a Christian, or even Inspirational novel.

I'm a 22-year-old recent college graduate who majored in Communications and completed a highly educational internship at the Media Education Foundation ([...] a remarkable nonprofit organization.  I was raised to be very open-minded, yet when I first arrived at college even I thought things had gotten out of hand. I was astounded by the number of women students who would readily bare their breasts in large groups of students, with little provocation (and a few beers).      When you're constantly bombarded with the likes of Abercrombie & Fitch ads, it's easy to believe that the portrayal of barely clad beautiful bodies cavorting sexually is the gold standard to emulate. There are no ads, of course, to portray the morning after regrets in our double standard culture that these women will be labeled (and feel like) \\""sluts\\"", while their male companions will relish their own enhanced party-animal status. I agree completely with MediaMaven about witnessing our \\""MTV Generation\\"" peers (especially women) who struggle with low self-esteem and depression -- it's epidemic on campus.         What I didn't realize before reading this book were the new \\""lows\\"" corporations and their advertisers had reached ~ Victoria's Secret makes thong panties for 8 to 12-year-olds?! It makes one wonder what the rates of depression and low self-esteem will be in 10 years.      So Sexy, So Soon is a call to action. While Norway and Sweden have banned all advertising aimed at children under age 12 - and Belgium, Denmark & Greece strongly restrict advertising targeted at children ~ why on earth should we allow the United States to stay mired in thismess? We should all heed the call to contact our Congressional Representatives, advocating a ban on all advertising aimed at children.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

Hidden in some sort of logbook, the painting went undiscovered for many years.  Unsure about what to do with such a treasure, Kate tries hard to find the owner.  Eventually the painting goes to auction and is sold for fifty million dollars.  Kate uses the money to quit her job and travel to Europe.  While in Europe, Kate finds the face in the painting.  She decides to search for the woman in the painting to give her the money.  Along the way, Kate learns the story of a Jewish girl named Hannah and the unknown painter Marc Chagall.  Their love becomes torn apart in the war, along with all of Hannah's family.<br /><br />Keeping Hannah Waiting is a story of one woman's quest.  Kate becomes rich but wants to give the money back to the person who really deserves it.  In her quest, she learns about herself.  She also learns more about Hannah and a painter who later became very famous, a Marc Chagall.  Kate learns a lot about the horrors of the Holocaust and how it ripped families apart.  Dave Clarke understands the pain of the survivors and writes realistically about the Holocaust.<br /><br />Clarke's novel is several stories together.  It is the story of Kate.  Clarke writes of a love between Hannah and Marc.  It is also the story of the Holocaust.  He weaved the stories together well.  Readers will be drawn into each piece.  They will experience the horrors of the Holocaust and how people tried to live normally after such an experience.  I kept reading, wondering about the ending.  Will Marc and Hannah get another chance?  Will Hannah get the money?  Will Kate find happiness?  The ending ties the novel up well.  Readers will not be disappointed after reading this book.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

I was interested to see what advice she'd have on cooking.<br /><br />Let me start by saying that this is an absolutely beautiful book. It's hardcover with bright green and orange ribbon bookmarks. The paper is thick and the book is packed with vibrant, colorful photos that will make your mouth water.<br /><br />The book is divided into six chapters beginning from January/February and ending with November/December, so no matter what season it is, you can find out what's available and how to prepare it.  Within the chapters, Raven highlights five to fifteen foods, but as you might expect, there are more options in the summer months than winter.<br /><br />Each food section begins with information about the food--different varieties, how to select them, basic preparation instructions, etc. The introduction is followed by a selection of recipes featuring that food.  The Green Bean section, for example, includes recipes such as Summer Garden Tempura, Spaghetti with Beans and Tomatoes, and Trofie with Potatoes, Beans, and Pesto (trofie is a type of pasta).<br /><br />Because of the subtitle \\""Cooking with fruits and vegetables,\\"" I thought this would be a vegetarian cookbook. It's not. There are quite a few meat dishes, particularly in the herb sections. But out of the 450 recipes in the book, I found plenty of recipes that are free of animal products, or can be easily made so by substituting vegan versions of dairy products. Here are some examples of some vegan or easily veganized recipes in the book.<br /><br />January/February:<br />- Savoy Cabbage and Cilantro Soup: made with coconut milk, chilis, and lime juice--YUM!<br />- The Ultimate Minestrone: made with cranberry beans, veggies, and red wine--just omit the pancetta and enjoy!<br /><br />March/April<br />- Vegetable Korma: A curry with cauliflower, carrots, parsnips, and green beans.<br />- Rhubarb Sorbet: Oh my gosh--a total treat even for non-rhubarb lovers.<br />- Spinach and Lentil Soup: Indian spices and coconut milk.<br /><br />May/June<br />- Salad of Asparagus, Fava Beans, Arugula, and Peas: Green and light--the perfect spring salad.<br />- New Potatoes in Saffron Dressing: Sherry and red chilis give the dressing a kick.<br />- Strawberries with Ros&eacute; Wine: a popular dessert in France.<br /><br />July/August<br />- French Apricot Jam: Made with vanilla beans.<br />- Pantzarosalata: A puree of beets, walnuts, bread, and seasonings to eat as a dip with pita bread.<br />- Zucchini and lemon salad: A great raw summer salad.<br />- Grilled New Carrots: Vegans can barbeque too!<br />- Tomato Bruschetta: Mix your ripe, summer tomatoes with fresh basil and spread them over good Italian bread.<br /><br />September/October<br />- Uncooked Apple Chutney: A raw, fermented chutney that keeps for months.<br />- Spiced Eggplant Salad: Eggplant and Indian spices that go perfect with flatbread.<br />- Rosemary Saddleback Potatoes: Though there are lots of wonderful potato recipes in this book, I had to try this. You slice the potatoes almost all the way through, insert sprigs of rosemary between the slices, drizzle with olive oil and bake. So good!<br />- Pears Poached in Saffron Syrup: Pears with cardamom and saffron--very exotic.<br /><br />November/December<br />- Ribollita: A hearty stew of beans, kale, carrots and other winter veggies.<br />- Orange and Cranberry Pies: Substitute a good nonhydrogenated margarine for the butter and you can make these yummy holiday pies.<br /><br />That's just a sampling, but as you can see, there's a lot to choose from.<br /><br />One other caution about the book--the author lives in England and includes foods that are not common in the United States (at least not in California) like gooseberries, salisfy, samphire, elderberries, and medlars. It's interesting to read about them, but they're not something I usually see at my farmers' market so I don't know how useful those sections are. On the other hand, if I do come across them, I suppose I'd be more likely to try them for having this book.<br /><br />\\""In Season\\"" is as enjoyable to read and peruse as it is to cook from. It would make a nice gift for friends that garden or are trying to eat more fruits and vegetables--and a nice give for nonvegetarians that would introduce them to many vegetarian dishes.<br /><br />Review as seen in VegFamily Magazine by Cathe Olsonee at my farmers' market so I don't know how useful those sections are.

Why do you need XML web services? More applications are moving to the web.  Installation and configuration tasks are reduced to zero when using XML web services.  Upgrades using Web services apply changes immediately.  Virtually, every computer has a web browser, so client end software is not an issue.  Applications using the Internet must connect to more logic and data separate across multiple machines.<br />2. XML web services use XML for data representation.  XML data is transport over HTTP.  It is easy to flow information through the firewall.  You start by making some request from some client application.  This triggers a response from the server.  The requesting message carries information about the parameters required by the function.  The web server initiates the function and returns the XML data.  Http is not a proprietary data communication protocol like DCOM.<br />3. You can exchange messages using XML web services via HTTP-GET and HTTP-POST.<br />4. You must figure out what parameters to pass to the web service and you need to know what is to be returned.<br />5.

There are lots of practical ideas in it that are easy to put into place. I like the emphasis on building EQ into everyday situations but also making special time for it as well. The use of art and drama was very useful to me as I had not done this before with my children so I found that was another way for me to help them deal with the issues they are facing. The book is filled with interesting quotes which are very inspiring. The work of many of EQ's leaders is synthesized and written in a way that all teachers can benefit from. There are also reflective questions which help you as a teacher think about how much you are really doing to develop children's EQ.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

An elitist, ego-centric, ethno-centric, uncompassionate, un-empathetic, and a narrow-boxed view of things (seemingly based in the school of Scientology) breakdown of procrastination is what you get. I understand that this book is meant to be a 'no-excuses' book camp for the mind. Motivation however does not have to be belittling. Pressfield manages to dispel psychology and modern medicine and the fact that some people have real problems. Moreover; he not only mocks the idea of socio-economic status being a real influence in procrastination and where life leads us; but he goes as far as to mock the culture(s) that may live within. Negatively referring to 'RAP' music and using the term 'Homies' in a discerning tone; as if an affluent male born in 1943 is such an expert to comment on these things.    Take out the fact that over 80% of this book has 1 page chapters, or that the same message is delivered in this 'cliff's notes' style; what Pressfield has done is to take his own life and his own experiences and said \\""This is how I see it; this is how it is; everyone in this world is afforded the same health and opportunities as me; see how I can fit everything into a neat box?\\"".

Its almost spring break and that means everyone is heading to the O.C. to cheer on the varsity cheer squad compete at Extreme. All right, so not everyone is going, while Mina and the guys are headed for fun, Kelly, Jacinta, and Lizzie are stuck at home...well, they're supposed to be stuck at home until one of them comes up with a surefire plan to get them all to the Extreme. But can things actually work out for the three girls? With her new Upper status, Mina can't wait to head to O.C for spring break and the Extreme. Sure, it sucks that some of the clique has to stay behind on vacation, but it gives her a chance to enjoy her time with the Uppers...including her sworn enemy Jessica Johnson. But when Jessica mysteriously calls a truce before the Extreme, is it too good to be true?    What I love about Ms. Chase's books is the realism she brings to her characters and high school life in general. Everyone can identify with the cliques, especially the exclusive Uppers. Jessica is the perfect mean girl, willing to do whatever it takes to make sure Mina ends up back on the outside of the Uppers. And what she has in mind for poor Mina is truly disastrous. I'm anxious to see what happens in the next book, because there's definitely going to be fall-out from this one. My favorite part of THAT'S WHAT'S UP is when the book shifts to the O.C. and the Extreme itself. That's when things truly got interesting. All in all, THAT'S WHAT'S UP is a great third book in the series.

And making it a hardcover release is simple greed. Honestly I'm surprised they didn't go all the way and sell the book wrapped in plastic to keep browsers from reading it in its entirety right there in the store. Had this been published free online as a promotion for the next novel it might have generated some good will. But this way is simply going to alienate anyone who shelled out actual cash.    But that isn't why I give it 2 stars. Thats all for the story it self. Telling the story from Thomas's view could have been interesting, but wasn't. The stories length denies it any chance of developing characters, or even generate interest. Which is a pity because the oblivion war premise could definitely be a great story were it given the effort that normally goes into Butcher's novels.     The story reads to me a lot like a outline for a novel rather than a short story. With just a marginal bit of information to explain the setting and characters to new comers to the series. But since it has exactly as much excitement as an outline I doubt its going to motivate them to try the one of the novels. Fans of the series will of course be right at home with the setting, which makes the book seem even shorter as all the new story information could be easily written in a single page. I'm seriously wondering if the entire story might be just a setup for the ending joke, a shame it wasn't funny.       For newcomers to the series, I beg them to skip this and try the novels, this does not do justice to what is one of my favorite series. Dresden fans who want to read this are advised to get it from their library. If you must buy a copy to complete your collection I strongly suggest looking at garage sales, I have no doubt many people will be selling there copies. But unless you got a signed copy this isn't worth anywhere near cover price.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

Vital and applicable to both lay people and experts, the book flows seamlessly and spirally from scholarship, to textual interpretation, to case studies, and the analysis of dreams. Shalit draws on an impressive breadth of scholarship and myths/fairy tales, looking at both history (e.g., the Crusades or Masada) and story.<br /><br />The book first discusses the key aspects of the Hero, considering Byron, the work of Robert Graves and Robert Bosnak, the Bible, and Joseph Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces, among many other sources.<br /><br />I take as my starting point the condition of mythlessness in the modern world, as expressed by Jung and reinforced by Campbell and how it is limiting our vision and ability to cure an ailing world rife with war and economic/environmental woes.<br /><br />If ever we needed to consider the role of the Hero, it is now.<br /><br />Consider the mistaken mythologizing of the death and wounding, respectively, of Pat Tillman and Jessica Lynch. While both are certainly heroes, the government's and media's manipulation of their circumstances (used to try and justify an unjustifiable war) bring to mind David Mamet's Wag the Dog, the 1997 film adaptation of Larry Beinhart's novel, American Hero.<br /><br />The people love their heroes and their construction for societal consumption by the government and the media has become no less than a High Art.<br /><br />Shalit says, on p. 24: \\""In society, the hero may be the messenger of hope who lights the torch of democracy. Sometimes it is amazing how, at the right moment in history, the heroism of a nation, spurting forth through layers of oppression, creates dramatic changes and overthrows worn-out regimes.\\""<br /><br />Might this apply to U.S. president-elect Barak Obama? Many people think so, and many more find themselves hoping so. Then again, there are many who see him as the shadow, using the term antichrist, and finding similarities between he and Nicolae Carpathia in the Left Behind series.<br /><br />If ever we needed to consider the role of the Hero, it is now.<br /><br />Consider the current fascination with Superheroes in the age of CGI and comic book cinema. Just last night I watched Christopher Nolan's record-shattering The Dark Knight, which takes as its thesis the complicated interrelationship of the hero and the shadow. Given the death of Heath Ledger, who played the Joker, the notions of the Hero are expanded to the realm of the Artist and his or her relationship with Pain.<br />When Shalit writes, on p. 95, \\""...life thrives in the shadow; in our detested weaknesses, complex inferiorities and repressed instincts there is more life and inspiration than in the well-adjusted compliance of the persona,\\"" I think that his words bring Ledger's death into sharp relief. As an acting teacher who works almost exclusively with teens, many of which see Ledger's \\""dying for his art\\"" as a form of heroism (an interpretation with which I disagree; it discounts the necessity of craft in preventing such tragedies), I think it is more important than ever to examine carefully the Hero's role and relationship to the shadow.<br /><br />The shadow is Jung's term for the unconscious, the \\""thing a person has no wish to be\\"" (p. ix). His early experience of his own shadow is, to me, some of the most compelling and useful text in his Memories, Dreams, and Reflections.<br /><br />The hero must go into the shadow (the forest, the depth of the sea, the desert, the cave¬--Plato's or the Celtic Bard's) to retrieve his soul. The shadow is a place of misery, calling to mind Schopenhauer's ideas about life being mostly pain and sorrow and Campbell's advice to \\""follow your bliss\\"" [sat chit ananda].<br /><br />Much of what Shalit centers on as aspects of the Hero are present in the shaman, who also has \\""one foot in divinity, one in the world of mortals\\"" (p. 33). The journey into the netherworld (often to retrieve or heal the soul), the returning with precious gifts of knowledge, the responsibility of re-integration into the community (see Mircea Eliade's comprehensive works on shamanism), all parallel the hero's journey. The modes of the vision quest and the alchemical transformation are, further, symbolically manifested in the landscape of the fairy tale.<br /><br />Pursuing this idea, Shalit, in the tradition of Robert Bly's Iron John or Bruno Bettelheim's Uses of Enchantment, ably presents and dissects a number of fairy tales, myths, and Biblical stories in the course of the book.<br /><br />\\""Nixie of the Millpond\\"" is presented without commentary. The myth of Perseus, however, is told with commentary from a wide variety of sources mixed in. It would be valuable to watch Clash of the Titans (1981) after reading this section, as it brings Shalit's analysis visually to life. Page 47 lists eight traits of the hero myth to guide the interpretation. I would add a ninth--the use of magical items (such as Athena's shield, Hermes' sword, and the three gifts of the Stygian nymphs, all of which are given to Perseus to defeat the Medusa).<br /><br />I have used these same basic elements of the hero myth for the past decade in my theatre workshops with youth and in my books on using drama in the classroom.<br /><br />If our youth are to break the limiting conventions of societal and governmental structures that have put the planet and its inhabitants in a place of crisis, they--and those who guide and educate them--must understand the Hero and Shadow both.<br /><br />On p. 65 Shalit writes, \\""Collective consciousness constitutes a threat by its demand on compliance with rules, roles and regulations.\\"" The mythological fighting of dragons and monsters by the Hero is most clearly articulated to me by Joseph Campbell, when, in various books and interviews, he talked about Nietzsche describing the cycle of life as beginning as a camel loaded down with the requirements of parents and society. The camel then goes into the desert (one of the hero landscapes I mentioned earlier) to become the lion, who must slay the dragon whose scales all say \\""Thou Shalt.\\"" This dragonslaying, certainly a noble and necessary undertaking, situates the Hero as the classic warrior, akin to Michael the Archangel and St. George, but when the fighting is done, the warrior must put down the sword. Whether we speak of the Vulcans comprising the Bush administration (as author James Mann terms them) or an abused child who grows up to wage ongoing battles even on a landscape of peace in a more stable family situation, this is a notion well worth focusing on. I think of the Roman general Cincinnatus, who moved back and forth between sword and plow and the dwarves of the novels of Dan Parkinson, who switch the hammer from one hand to the other as necessary in times of peace and war.<br /><br />The hero struggling with the shadow often projects onto a demonized Other because, as Shalit reminds us, \\""Since shadows easily lend themselves to projection [see pgs. 97-101 for the three types identified by Jung], they are discovered so much more easily in the other than oneself\\"" (p. 84). This is, of course, the source of most of the ugliness in the history of Humankind.<br /><br />The Biblical explorations/interpretations presented are a high point of the book (see, for example, p. 63 on the Virgin Mary) and begin in earnest with the section on the shadow. The etymology of both biblical and mythological names given throughout add much to the discussion.<br /><br />Shalit uses Oscar Wilde's \\""doppelganger novel,\\"" Picture of Dorian Gray, to explore the notion of shadow in terms of our duality, as Dorian is projecting his shadow onto the canvas. Duality--war/peace, animus/anima, masculine/feminine, dark/light--is prevalent throughout the book.<br /><br />The second half of the book deals with the Enemy, Cripple, and Beggar of the title. The Enemy (the projection onto the Other that is really the shadow in oneself) is explored through such Biblical figures as Amalek, Samson, Jacob, and the key figures in the trial of Jesus. The section on the Fathers and the Collective Consciousness, dealing with Caiaphas, the Sanhedrin, Barabbas, and Judas, is fascinating reading. The connection of the father and the son resounds on many levels, including the relationship of Jesus/Judas as being nearly inseparable.<br /><br />The Cripple (one's weaknesses and inner wounds) is explored through mythological/fictional figures such as Hephaestus, Ptah, Oedipus, Quasimodo, and the child in Hans Christian Andersen's \\""The Cripple.\\"" There are case studies here that serve many of the same functions as the analyses of the myths and fairy tales, and will appeal to those interested in the dynamics of Jungian analysis. Certain aspects of the second case study reminded me of Don Juan DeMarco (1995), the film starring Marlon Brando and Johnny Depp, especially considering that love (Eros) is the means to heal the Cripple, as articulated so well in this book.<br /><br />The final section deals with the Beggar (the \\""door that leads to the passageway of the Self,\\"" p. 225), which is the Inner Voice or Daemon. Shalit deals here with the notions of alchemy that so fascinated Jung. I was intrigued by the story of King Solomon as the wandering beggar and Shalit's exploration of the life of the prophet Elijah.<br /><br />In closing, I want to mention the cover art, a painting titled \\""Emerging\\"" by Susan Bostrom-Wong, an artist and Jungian analyst. Shalit asks the reader to examine the images embedded in the human figure. It is well worth the time to do so. Like the book itself, the longer you look, the more you will see.<br /><br />I urge educators, artists, and those in search of new paths toward a life well-lived to buy this book. I know that one of my own heroes, Joseph Campbell, certainly would.desert (one of the hero landscapes I mentioned earlier) to become the lion, who must slay the dragon whose scales all say \\""Thou Shalt.\\"" This dragonslaying, certainly a noble and necessary undertaking, situates the Hero as the classic warrior, akin to Michael the Archangel and St. George, but when the fighting is done, the warrior must put down the sword. Whether we speak of the Vulcans comprising the Bush administration (as author James Mann terms them) or an abused child who grows up to wage ongoing battles even on a landscape of peace in a more stable family situation, this is a notion well worth focusing on. I think of the Roman general Cincinnatus, who moved back and forth between sword and plow and the dwarves of the novels of Dan Parkinson, who switch the hammer from one hand to the other as necessary in times of peace and war.    The hero struggling with the shadow often projects onto a demonized Other because, as Shalit reminds us, \\""Since shadows easily lend themselves to projection [see pgs. 97-101 for the three types identified by Jung], they are discovered so much more easily in the other than oneself\\"" (p. 84). This is, of course, the source of most of the ugliness in the history of Humankind.    The Biblical explorations/interpretations presented are a high point of the book (see, for example, p. 63 on the Virgin Mary) and begin in earnest with the section on the shadow. The etymology of both biblical and mythological names given throughout add much to the discussion.    Shalit uses Oscar Wilde's \\""doppelganger novel,\\"" Picture of Dorian Gray, to explore the notion of shadow in terms of our duality, as Dorian is projecting his shadow onto the canvas. Duality--war/peace, animus/anima, masculine/feminine, dark/light--is prevalent throughout the book.    The second half of the book deals with the Enemy, Cripple, and Beggar of the title. The Enemy (the projection onto the Other that is really the shadow in oneself) is explored through such Biblical figures asAmalek, Samson, Jacob, and the key figures in the trial of Jesus. The section on the Fathers and the Collective Consciousness, dealing with Caiaphas, the Sanhedrin, Barabbas, and Judas, is fascinating reading. The connection of the father and the son resounds on many levels, including the relationship of Jesus/Judas as being nearly inseparable.    The Cripple (one's weaknesses and inner wounds) is explored through mythological/fictional figures such as Hephaestus, Ptah, Oedipus, Quasimodo, and the child in Hans Christian Andersen's \\""The Cripple.\\"" There are case studies here that serve many of the same functions as the analyses of the myths and fairy tales, and will appeal to those interested in the dynamics of Jungian analysis. Certain aspects of the second case study reminded me of Don Juan DeMarco (1995), the film starring Marlon Brando and Johnny Depp, especially considering that love (Eros) is the means to heal the Cripple, as articulated so well in this book.    The final section deals with the Beggar (the \\""door that leads to the passageway of the Self,\\"" p. 225), which is the Inner Voice or Daemon. Shalit deals here with the notions of alchemy that so fascinated Jung. I was intrigued by the story of King Solomon as the wandering beggar and Shalit's exploration of the life of the prophet Elijah.    In closing, I want to mention the cover art, a painting titled \\""Emerging\\"" by Susan Bostrom-Wong, an artist and Jungian analyst. Shalit asks the reader to examine the images embedded in the human figure. It is well worth the time to do so. Like the book itself, the longer you look, the more you will see.     I urge educators, artists, and those in search of new paths toward a life well-lived to buy this book. I know that one of my own heroes, Joseph Campbell, certainly would.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

Her first mystery, the crackling Cover Her Face is more a golden age mystery than a new wave modern writer.  Until A Unsuitable Job for A Woman, followed by the first breakthrough novel, Death of an Expert Witness, that Ms. James did not crack the usual mold. Then she rose way beyond what most other mystery writers had attained (well, let's not forget Ruth Rendell and Wexford).  First, the quality of her writing. It transcends Christie, but that's to be expected; Dame Agatha never pretended to be a great writer but a great plotter with characters one fell in love with. Ms. James continued to evolve her characters and along with that, of her detective Adam Dalgliesh, so memorably portrayed on BBC TV by Roy Marsden.  AD, as his colleagues refer to him, is smart, articulate, a poet, no less and one who appears to have unending empathy for his fellow men and women, even if some of them commit murders.  Her first great book, A Taste For Death has been followed by a group of  excellent, enjoyable and weighty mystery novels, sensibly published over two or three years' gap in time. Let's discount the disastrous Innocent Blood.  In this, what could be the ailing 88 year old writer's last book, the action takes place at Cheverall Hall, outside of the magnificent old house, once a witch was burnt. Really? Why someone was digging into the stones in the night.  The build up is terrific. The meaty characters are well penned. The village atmosphere, so obligatory in early Christies, cannot be sustained. But it is Adam Dalgliesh who is the most disappointing of all. He has not shown any growth. His love affair and upcoming marriage appear more as irritating intrusions in a thus far excellent detective novel.  His meeting with his prospective father in law, is more like Gielgud in Brideshead Revisited. The secondary mystery is unsatisfactory and the denounement is weak.   But it is a PD JAMES and ADAM DALGLIESH book. We are thankful for that and finish it staying up late.   Always wishing there will be another one.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

Most books of that genre spill much ink filling in extra details of important historical events. Waugh, however, has a different purpose: he would like the reader to view sainthood in a different light by seeing the path to sainthood that St. Helen trod. As such, he glances over some seemingly important details: he doesn't even try to recreate the events surrounding Helena's conversion to Christianity, and he introduces her desire to find the True Cross practically as an aside. I found Waugh's focus in this book a bit quixotic; most of the book is focused on Helena's pre-Christian life, and the chapters on her life after converting seem an afterthought.<br /><br />Yet reading this book is thoroughly enjoyable; Waugh's humor runs throughout the book. In fact, \\""Helena\\"" is worth its price just for Fausta's speech to Helena after Helena arrives at Rome. It begins with a discussion of Pope Sylvester:<br /><br />\\""Sylvester? Oh yes, of course you'll have to meet him. It's only polite. And of course we all respect his office. But he's not a man of any personal distinction, I assure you. If he's ever declared a saint they ought to commemorate him on the last day of the year.\\""<br /><br />(For those not aware, St. Sylvester's feast day is celebrated on December 31st)<br /><br />Fausta's speech continues for some pages and is laugh out-loud funny at many points. These type of humorous interjections make this book, if nothing else, the funniest historical fiction you'll read. It will also make you think a bit more about what it means to be a saint; Waugh's contention is that the saint must do that \\""one thing\\"" which God has called him or her to do - nothing more, nothing less. There are worse definitions of saints than this, to be sure.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

It's the continuing saga of the Savannah vampires, William Cuyler Thorne and Jack McShane. I will do my best to do some telling without revealing.<br /><br />Due to the cliffhanger ending of book two, William is forced to go on a journey far from the city he's been protecting for centuries, leaving it under the protection of Jack. Since William is the biggest, baddest otherworldly creature around town there have been few problems in Savannah in the past, but the word is out that Jack's been left in charge. Can he keep the city safe from ne'er-do-well werewolves while his sire is away?<br /><br />Will William be able to successfully complete his quest as he struggles to reconcile his past with the most vile evil he's ever come across? Will his weakness be his downfall? Is there truth to the prophecy of a slayer?<br /><br />Who or what exactly is Connie, the beautiful cop that Jack has taken a shining to?<br /><br />The story has a creative, interesting plot with vampires, werewolves, voodoo, zombies and the story unfolds at a perfect pace. As always, the author does an excellent job with character development. This is the first time that William and Jack are separated and the conflicts they meet and how they handle them are a true test of their strengths and weaknesses. It's a very thrilling read that's just the right length and will appeal to anyone that enjoys the paranormal genre. The book has a cliffhanger ending leading to the next book, The Vampire's Betrayal, that was released in April, 2008. The fifth book in the series, The Vampire's Revenge, is due out in January, 2009.<br /><br />I can't say it enough-these are just great reads. This series is as thrilling as it is funny and it never lets up. You don't necessarily have to read the preceding books in order to enjoy this one, but I highly recommend you do. You'll get such a wealth of information on the characters that will lead to a better understanding of their depth. Highly recommended and one of my favorite series'.highly recommend you do.

The fictional portion of this book dealing with the characters involved is very sophomoric and borders on the absurd. All of the characters are way over the top stereotyped to the point of being unbelievable. Reading this book reminds me of some high school paper. This writer obviously is not an experienced writer of fiction.     I think he would have been better served if he had written the book as a straight factual commentary and left out the fictional component to it. To me that detracts from what he is trying to get across to his readers. The author obviously comes from a very technical background and the fact that he has two patents dealing with technical computer programming does not qualify him as an expert in this area.     When it comes to pure writing talent, there is none here. That is why the author had to use his own money to self publish this book through Iuniverse. No regular book publisher would give this book any serious consideration, not because of the content, but because of the very poor writing in and of itself.     With regard to the factual claims of the author, I will leave it to the theologians to debate this out. Suffice it to say that even if you accept as true the \\""facts\\"" the author presents, it still does not lead one to the conclusion that \\""all dogs go to heaven\\"". Such a conclusion is a far leap from the facts presented.     You must take the Bible as a whole and not just pull ourt parts to justify your conclusions. Such a practice is called \\""text proofing\\"" and is not a valid way of interpreting the Bible. The author conveniently disregards so many things, there isn't time to go into them all here. To provide just one to think about is the concept of satan. No scholar denies that satan is referred to and described in detail throughout the Bible. To what is satan's desire then, to just have us live godless lives here on earth and to watch us suffer a temporary punishment whenwe die? This would be akin to a nonbeliever getting a \\""time-out\\"" from God until we become good boys and girls and are allowed to join Him.     In closing, don't waste your money on this book. I cannot recommend this book for two reasons. First, the writing is terrible. Second, the research and analysis are incomplete.     The author makes the huge leap that a fifth century theologian named Jerome intentionally removed and rewrote parts of the Bible to further his own evil desires of control and this conspiracy has been hidden until now. This author would have us believe that only he has just now ferreted out this vast conspiracy that has been hidden from us all these years. As John Stossel on 20/20 would say: \\""Give me a break\\"".","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

Although I enjoyed that book, I didn't love it.  (Thought it was too long for the story/plotline provided.)  However, I knew that I wanted to read more by this author.  A trip to the UBS scored DEEP IN THE VALLEY and I started it immediately, knowing it was from a different series.  I was hooked right off the bat.    I thoroughly enjoy Carr's easy, fluid writing style, and I couldn't help but find myself immersed in the characters inhabiting the quaint California mountain town of Grace Valley.  They're quirky and kind and flawed and wonderful.  The biggest surprise for me, in reading Deep in the Valley, was how many times I laughed out loud.  I'm normally not that kind of reader, but Carr writes with great humanity and great (sneaky!) humor.  By the time I turned the last page, all I could think about was hunting down the remaining books in this series.  I wanted more, more, more!    The only thing that stops me from giving this book 5 stars is just that it doesn't really seem like a romance.  The protagonist of the novel, Dr. June Hudson, does have a love interest, but he has maybe four scenes in the entire book.  (The love story of June and her mystery man are continued in the other two books of the series.)  Since the book says \\""Romance\\"" right on the spine, I guess I expected more, well, romance.  But that didn't stop this book from being a wonderful read, and I feel a HUGE author glom coming on.    There's a lot happening in this book -- the sheer number of characters necessitates action -- but if you are particularly drawn to character-rich stories, I recommend this one (and this author!) to you.  There's not necessarily a lot of passion here...but there's a ton of heart!","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

She is blinkered both about how the ower classes re treated in the City and how they re treated in Maycomb.  What she did not see as a child was that Atticus did not fight for Tom because he was black but because he could prove Tom did not rape the girl. It was his job and he wanted to prove that he could win  that particular case, especially when all the odds were stacked up against Tom and Atticus knew it would be a hard fight.  He did it for himself, not Tom. Even when realisation dawns that Atticus could possibly be prejudiced (in his own way) she still doesn't see that he primarily a lawyer first and to prove that  injustice is being done is more important to him than personal feelings.

In Plague Lords AP has busted another of the silly, jingoistic myths upon which this series is based. For 3 zillion books the series has focused on the remnants of the USA conducting a fratricidal war that features the wholesale bloodletting of every person necessary to survival of the species. The big lie is that if so much of the US survived, then what is happening in the other parts of the civilized world that wouldn't be prime targets for meltdown? As AP posits, central and south America would be mostly intact. At last count, both areas have lots of military assets sold to them by the US, Soviets, Germans, Brits, French and Israelis. Brazil has a fleet of 95 ships, including an aircraft carrier, missile frigates, and subs. It also has also developed biofuels to the point where it no longer depends on foreign oil. Chile has 60 plus ships, Argentina as we know hit the Brits hard in the Falklands naval battles. If north America is nuked and still exists, then south and central America are world powers.    PL is the story of what happens when one segment of the southern survivors heads north and Ryan and the Band have the misfortune to land in their path. The bad guys soften up the opposition by using human bioweapons that spread genetically altered diseases. The action is fast paced and fully up to the high standard AP maintains, both in description and dramatic effect. The \\""AP Twist\\"" herein is the character of the doomed, pathethic Daniel Desipio. Desipio just happens to be a pre-nukecaust pulp writer who has seen his \\""art\\"" go awry. This has to be the saddest and funniest character ever introduced into this genre. I eagerly await the re-printing of Desipio's \\""Slaughter Realms\\"" books, featuring the famed Iroquois Ninja Princess, perhaps in a three volume collection. As for Ryan et al in this two-parter, I think they have met their match.    DL storylines may come and go, but whenever AP is contracted to write for this series we readers win. I wish AP had a series where he was in creative control. Grab this book while you can: my bookstore started with 25 copies on the day of release and they are already gone.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

While the sex, drugs, and teen angst may all seem a little cliché, Chbosky does an amazing job of realistically portraying high school situations in a uniquely hilarious way through the protagonist Charlie. The story is told through Charlie's devastating letters to whom the reader may not know he is writing. The theme woven through Charlie's letters is his constant struggle between passivity and passion. Letter by letter the reader is drawn into Charlie's fanatical world only to be in awe at the story's end.     The story begins with the start of Charlie's freshman year in high school where he is prone to depression, shy, introverted, and \\""on the fringes of life\\"" after dealing with the losses of a friend and his Aunt Helen. He is a wallflower, someone intelligent beyond his years but socially awkward. Some of the few people to notice Charlie's intelligence are his English teacher and newfound senior friends Sam and Patrick. With their help Charlie comes to terms with life and learns to interact. Letter by letter the plot unfolds as Charlie learns to deal with almost every tough issue know to a teen. Chbosky handles these tragic issues so well that they come off as realistic rather than over-the-top. This realism is why I believe The Perks of Being a Wallflower is such a special book.    Chbosky further develops the theme of Charlie's struggle between passivity and passion through the constant pressures he must face in his freshman year in high school. Whether it is dances, first dates, drugs, sexuality, or the Rocky Horror Picture Show, Charlie is relentlessly barraged with the task of eliminating his social awkwardness. Chbosky's realistic style leaves an impact on the reader by placing him or her into Charlie's world. There the reader gets an up close and personal view of each developing situation and becomes attached to the ups and downs associated with Charlie's life. Charlie's relationship with his teacher Bill also parallels one of the major themes of the novel. This theme is the clash between young adult and adult culture. While Charlie is trying to identify himself as a man, he continuously finds himself running away from his life and reverting back to a childlike state. Bill acts as an intermediate force between these clashing worlds and tries to get Charlie to lead a normal high school life and further provide an identity for Charlie. Bill helps Charlie get his mind off the things Charlie is running away from through books and essay writing.    In my opinion, Perks of Being a Wallflower is an amazing book that should be read by all high school students. Chbosky offers humor, drama, and a unique quality to the story that keeps the reader entertained with each turning page. The novel is truly an entertaining read and I would recommend it to anyone who has experienced the highs and lows of high school.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

Set in the late 1980s/early 1990s, the author revisits the Brooklyn landscape with Midnight coming of age against the backdrop of a tough urban setting. He navigates the streets and survives largely because of his faith, devotion to his family, adherence to paternal anecdotes and African proverbs. The subtitle refers to a romance between the adolescent Midnight and his Japanese soulmate, Akemi, a world-renowned teen sensation visiting New York with family for an international art competition. Despite the language barrier, they fall in love and what ensues is a discovery and sharing of cultures, tradition, and drama.<br /><br />The author paints Midnight as a noble and admirable character holding fast to his beliefs amid temptations of the heart, flesh, and street. Sister Souljah withholds little and expounds, rather bluntly, the shortfalls of American popular culture via Midnight's immigrant eyes and voice. One does not have to read between the lines to note the critique on society's morals, the skewing and corruption of values, the apparent lack of respect for elders and women, high level of promiscuity, lack of personal responsibility, the worship of money, etc. If nothing more, I think it is a rally to \\""wake up\\"" and heed the message(s) that call for self-examination and reflection. As my rating reflects, I enjoyed the novel and all it offered; however others might find it a bit \\""preachy\\"" or condescending, not to mention woefully disappointing that it is not the much anticipated sequel to The Coldest Winter Ever.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

This new book includes a three-phase workout to go along with the three-phase diet plan.  The diet phases are:  Phase 1: Eat lean protein, high-fiber legumes, low-fat dairy, good fats (including some nuts), and plenty of vegetables.  There are no highly processed refined carbs allowed.  This phase is supposed to jump-start weight loss, control blood sugar swings, and eliminate cravings for sugar and refined starches. Phase 1 usually continues for 2 weeks.   Phase 2:  Introduce whole fruits and high-fiber whole grains to your diet while continuing with adequate protein such as fish, shellfish, chicken, turkey, lean beef or pork, or soy protein.  Phase 3:  Eating is not regulated and the book allows an occasional sugary food or bagel, though does not recommend going back to your old habits.      The exercise program combines both high intensity and low intensity interval exercise focusing on a 10 week walking program, as well as a shaping and toning exercise program of 27 exercises with photos.     Also included are new meal plans for Phase 1 and Phase 2, expanded lists of foods to eat and foods to avoid for Phase 1 and Phase 2, latest nutrition research, testimonials, weight loss tips, Q & A based on reader questions, and many excellent recipes (Turkey Meatloaf, Veggie Chili, etc.).      The basic diet advice of low sugar while emphasizing high-fiber, nutrient-rich carbohydrates, healthy fats, lean protein, and low-fat dairy is sound.  This updated version of the South Beach diet is a good book for learning about healthy eating, and it includes a moderate and beneficial exercise program.  It is a reasonable and well-documented approach to a healthy lifestyle.  It is worth reading or listening to!

Behr is tough, he is devoted. He's also a bit sick in the head, which is what endears him to some, and turns others off. Here he pursues a serial killer, working with a profiler whom he naturally has to bed, despite trying to keep things going with the mother of his son. Behr educates himself, calls in favors, does lots of digging, and soon finds his man. How things turn out after that may well be in keeping with the character Behr, but not all audiences will find it a satisfying resolution. Those of us who have read many serial killer novels will see many similarities, and the story has some predictability to it, except for this, it's Frank Behr wrapping it up.

I loved finding out how much they have grown in their trust of the Infinite and their ability to follow His instructions to them since the end of book one. Though I must admit that, just like me, they have a lot more growing and maturing to do.<br /><br />In this book Ela’s parents and others from her hometown are much more developed and I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know more about them. I especially liked seeing the depth of Matron Prill and coming to understand more about her from the first glimpse that we had of her character in book one.<br /><br />As Kien and Ela are sent on two different paths to share the Infinite’s word in different areas there are many troubles and heartaches that each of them have to face. Even as they proceed along their own paths we learn more about their Creator and His love and mercy.<br /><br />I was really caught up in the conflict and action as the followers of the goddess Atea clashed with those who still believed in the Infinite. The correction that the Infinite brought at times throughout the book on different people was amazing.<br /><br />As someone who has read the bible for years it was wonderful to try and spot some of the different ideas and stories that are presented.

The last major biography was published in the 1930's, and it is indeed time for a full-scale modern biography which can benefit from intervening historical research and studies on Blackstone. And who better to undertake this mission than Wilfrid Prest, Emeritus at the University of Adelaide, who edited in 2006 the definitive edition of Blackstone's letters for the Selden Society, and who is one of the leading legal historians of 18th Century England, with a score of fine studies to his credit. Prest has sought to do more than just a biography--rather he seeks to relate Blackstone's life to the \\""law and letters of the 18th Century.\\"" However, be advised that this is a biography of Blackstone, not an analysis of the Commentaries.  There are many fine such studies (Boorstin, Duncan Kennedy, e.g.); Prest does discuss some facets of the books, but the man is his principal focus.    Each chapter chronologically covers a period in Blackstone's life.  It is interesting to note his rather broad intellectual interests: poetry; the classics; architecture; fine printing; theology; academic reform of Oxford University; and translations. Prest traces his advancement from a classical education at Charterhouse, to Pembroke College at Oxford, a fellowship at All Souls, and admission to the Middle Temple as a barrister. While Prest carefully discusses Blackstone's not overwhelming career at the bar, I found his deep and continuing involvement in reform efforts at Oxford to be more interesting, especially his heroic efforts to salvage the Oxford University Press. Of course in 1758 Blackstone becomes the first Vinerian Professor of Common Law, which adds to his reputation.  While not discussing the Commentaries in substance, Prest does sketch the background of how Blackstone came to deliver them first as lectures, then in four published volumes, as well asthe reactions to them. Blackstone's other and less-known publications also are discussed.    Blackstone's ultimate ambition was to become a judge; toward this end he did a stint in Parliament and performed other public services.  In 1770 he is appointed a judge, serving up with Lord Mansfield in the King's Bench division (interestingly, Prest recounts, Mansfield would not allow the Commentaries to be cited in his court).  Prest discusses Blackstone's judicial career, finding him to have been an \\""exceptionally careful, conscientious, and well-respected judge.\\"" The rather stinging criticisms of the young Jeremy Bentham (alleging that Blackstone was \\""the sworn enemy of reform\\"")and other critics are briefly discussed, as well as the continuing popularity of the Commentaries in England and America. The book runs some 300 pages of text, and includes an exceptional bibliography of original and primary sources, 22 pages of notes, and some wonderful illustrations, many in full color.  As usual, Prest's research is nothing less than incredibly comprehensive--he appears to have read everything pertinent.  And although his topic is a serious one, his writing style is anything but heavy and dull, it moves along nicely. All told, the wait for a superb Blackstone biography has been worth it with the publication of this fine volume.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

I literally stopped craving sweets.  I thought it was a gimmick when people mentioned that, how could I ever NOT crave sweets?  For the past three weeks I could think about nothing but donuts, Milk Duds, chocolate everything, pie, etc. and would go out of my way to get them.  Today I thought some sweets would be yummy, but I couldn't even tempt myself to eat some chocolate that was right in front of me.  It was like a switch had been flipped and I saw food as nourishment and not a comforting friend.<br /><br />I highly recommend reading this.  If you're on the road to being obese like I am, this could literally save your life.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

Take into account that this is not Mitchell, and just enjoy it for what it is, a well-written alternate ending to your favorite film.  The movie version was even well-done, there is no comparison to GWTW, but they're not attempting to match or better the prequel, just satisfy some appetites.  I think both are enjoyable.

John Rubino and his team must have spent an incredible amount of time digging into all the areas of clean tech, detailing their pros and cons, and surveying individual companies in each sector.    (I was able to get a sneak preview and comment on the book before its publication. But when the official version came out, I immediately re-read it, because there were so many pieces of valuable information that I had already forgotten.)    While I am a veteran in the field of alternative energy, I was surprised how many technologies are out there that I didn't fully know about. It can sometimes be overwhelming, or even uncomfortable, to hear about all these different technologies. But I am so glad that I now read about all these potential future developments. As an investor myself, it never hurts to have as much information as possible, and I don't even want to imagine what I would miss if I hadn't read the book.    John Rubino also blends the book with great macro-economics sections and investor advice. He is one of the few people right on the money, as he had predicted the real estate bust in his 2003 book, and he was consistently recommending to avoid or short homebuilders and investment banks, as in his regular interviews on Howestreet.com. He has certainly helped me and my investor group to stay clear of some of the collapses on Wall Street this year.    The current book is by no means just a promotion of all new clean technologies. On the contrary, it contains ample warnings about what can happen to overhyped technologies, what to look for, and how to avoid possible traps. It is an objective book for those interested in new technologies and investing.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

Obviously, I am not the target audience for this drivel as it's been almost 30 years since I've been a teen. But honestly, who in their right mind can describe this book as suspensful and thrilling?

Instead, we were subjected to page after page of cloying, plodding, and uninspiring prose describing Bella's love for Edward.

Especially during the summer of 1970.<br /><br />\\""His mother has volunteered the family to help build, as a reporter has dubbed it, 'the last bomb shelter of the cold war.' Gripped with a prepare-for-the-worst mentality, Joan O'Neill is a natural for this project. And during the summer of 1970, her internal alarms of impending danger are ringing. Her oldest son is fighting in Vietnam, her oldest daughter is off waging the sexual revolution, and a third is living with her communist boyfriend. Feeling helpless toward the three oldest, Joan O'Neill undertakes the bomb shelter project, hoping that involving her remaining children in a project of protection will somehow shield them from all the dangers that seem so imminent.<br /><br />\\""But in a small town far away from any militarily strategic target, the bomb shelter becomes an object of derision, and Ben's hopes for a summer of romance quickly fade. This is, until Brad Richardson, the blind owner of the local movie theater, joins the bomb shelter crew. It is through Brad that Ben meets Suzanne - a girl whose beauty is matched only by her refusal to be embarrassed about working on the bomb shelter. The romance between Ben and Suzanne progresses amidst the increasingly stormy events of a town suddenly caught up in a cascade of unintended consequences.<br /><br />\\""When their bus breaks down, a group of college students on their way to a political demonstration decide to stay and protest the bomb shelter. This siege of outside agitators turns the town into a cultural and political battleground, with the bomb shelter at ground zero. And despite all Joan O'Neill's good intentions, disaster ensues.\\""<br /><br />Patrick Garry's novel has captured a bit of time, the 1970s - the cold war, Vietnam, protests, sexual revolution, small town mores, young innocence, and adult promiscuity. A Bomb Shelter Romance is a simple, delightful story about a family and the unique characters who come together to finish this controversial project. It is well written, well edited, and Garry is an educated, consummate writer.<br /><br />Delightful...truly delightful!!...and highly recommended<br /><br />Kaye Trout<br />Reviewers who come together to finish this controversial project.

He was beautiful physically when he was young, even though his skin was bad, and as he aged and his bad living habits showed more and more on his body, he still retained the magnificent charisma and sex appeal that always set him apart from all others.  He always had that mysterious thing about him that made him absolutely riveting to watch no matter who else was onstage or onscreen.  This book, with its delving into his intellectualism and writing life and his Notebooks, which really give a picture of the man himself from inside his own head, is absolutely one of the best books I've ever read.  I feel like I actually got to know Richard Burton from reading this book.  A person's writings are one of the best keys to knowing what they think, and I think this book was magnificent.  He'd always fascinated me, and yet I knew next to nothing about him, aside from that he was a heavy drinker and was married to ET twice.  Now that I've read this book, he fascinates me even more.

This makes it reasonable to ask whether there's anything new. The most active branch of non-historical philosophy is so-called analytic philosophy, but it consists for the most part in nothing but treatments of highly specific and isolated problems in technical articles that are difficult to digest and are inaccessible to wider audiences. Epochal projects like those of the great thinkers of the tradition are scarcely to be found.<br /><br />There is, however, a massive exception: the 687-page book of Munich philosophy professor Lorenz B. Puntel with the sonorous title Struktur und Sein. The book appeared in 2006 and, this year, also in an English translation (Structure and Being). It is the most comprehensive, systematic, and up-to-the-minute work in contemporary philosophy. Specialists agree: there will still be talk of this book two hundred years from now. This is definitively not a philosophical mayfly. For anyone who is seriously interested in systematic philosophy that does not date from the distant past, it is a genuine must.<br /><br />Its just under 700 pages are full of formal logic, mathematics, semantics, and ontology. These will be thick boards to drill through-they are not vague and vagrant musings about heaven and earth. Here, at the highest scientific level, the entire philosophical canon is considered: theoretical systematics, epistemology, the question of truth, the question about the deepest structures of being, physics and cosmology and the question about God, but also ethics and the mind-body problem. There is simply everything in this book.<br /><br />This is an imposing resurrection of the Western metaphysics of being, here in modern dress. Having endured the purgatory of modernity, metaphysics has re-entered through the back door of analytic philosophy, and with it have come the truly great questions raised in human history.The author, Lorenz Puntel, is one of the rare cases of a scholar who is at home in many significant schools of philosophy. He began as a scholastic and then was a young star of German Hegelianism until he turned to analytic philosophy and there, too, became one of the leading thinkers. This is a writer who really knows what he is talking about.<br />Hence: anyone who wants to experience, quasi live, philosophy taking a powerful step forward, or who simply seeks philosophical overkill, will open this book and read.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

One cannot go far in acquiring a substantial vocabulary without Kanji, and it is essential for technical vocabulary.  This book is the single best resource for learning Kanji.  That Jack Halpern, author of the Kodansha Kanji Learner's Dictionary recommended it was sufficient for me to purchase it.  The brief mnemonics are creative, memorable and hew closely to traditional Japanese radical or component meanings. The truly unique and outstanding feature of this book is that Kanji are presented in order of frequency of appearance in Japan, each with a short vocabulary accompanying each Kanji example, with all vocabulary items consisting only of previously presented/learned Kanji!  As a Kanji learning tool, this book has no peer.  You start from the first Kanji, learning the meaning and pronunciation, and with the next Kanji, you learn vocabulary that includes the previous Kanji with pronunciation.  This approach is unique to this book and facilitates the most rapid acquisition of Kanji facility.  It is a perfect mate to Jack Halpern's book if additional vocabulary examples are desired, but is truly a stand-alone resource.  Get this with a good Japanese Text (like Genki), A Japanese Verb handbook (I like Kodansha's), the three Japanese Grammar Dictionaries by Makino and the Kodansha particle Dictionary and you are set for self-study.","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

Keep that in mind for I am not 100% kind to this book.     The novel's engineering aspects and its fencing and hunting terminologies are fastidiously and admirably researched. However, this fact is laboriously clear to the reader from page 1 and it bogs down the story and over burdens its prose often. There are few other descriptions in the story that are as well crafted as those aspects and that leaves the whole world and its characters collapse into two dimensions when none of those three topics are being discussed.     Now with the negative stuff out of the way it would seem that what is left after you parse out the negative aspects of this novel is still a fairly enjoyable story. It is fresh and it is new and these aspects cannot be over looked either. Though the world can be flat at times the history and structure of Mezentia, its Guilds, and its culture stands out in the novel. All characters within that context read very well. The others from outside those walls are much more often one-dimensional characters that operate more as cogs in the wheels of a rather \\""machined feeling\\"" narrative.     Clearly though, further books in the series could take off on a three dimensional narrative jaunt that might evoke more emotion and clarity of purposes. The story most certainly has that potential.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

My son has several books that are cute rhyming things about vehicles but still have a wrap up page to show the few things that don't fit the story but requires more explanation. So my son and i go back over it with the big words.   All this said, my son is turning 3 and this book was part of his birthday gift from my mom because he loves butterflies.

Many books on the subject make the mistake of emphasizing this complexity by seeking to cover every aspect of its every possible application. This approach is not suitable for photographers, who know that they need to be conversant with only certain groups of functions, but who need help in determining which groups are important and how best to utilize them. Without assistance this is not an easy task, and is invariably time consuming.    In this book, practicing professional photographer, lecturer, author and podcaster Derrick Story sifts the wheat from the chaff and demonstrates through clear and simple examples how efficient and effective use of the Photoshop CS4 suite (including Image Downloader, Adobe Bridge and Adobe Camera Raw) lies primarily with an understanding of the logical workflow that it facilitates.    Written in a pleasantly conversational but never condescending manner, the book comprises six main sections -- one for each of the workflow steps.    First is the importing of images using the Image Downloader function of CS4, including titling and addition of meta data which is most efficiently done in this environment.    Then comes the use of Adobe Bridge in rating images to establish a work priority, and in keywording to make later searching and organization easy and efficient.    The following two sections deal with basic and advanced editing of RAW (and now also JPEG and TIFF) image files in Adobe Camera Raw. A typical Raw workflow is laid out step-by-step, and the new localized editing functions of ACR explained and illustrated. The philosophy is that as much work as possible should be carried out non-destructively in ACR before resorting to Photoshop for the fine tuning.    The next section covers classic image adjustment techniques in Photoshop itself, concentrating on the improvements to tools and functions that CS4 incorporates.    This is followed by a collection of `Photoshop Recipes' covering a number of the adjustments most commonly needed in portraiture, architectural and landscape photography. Don't look here for mind-numbing techniques using dozens of layers -- these are understandable methods that can be applied every day with ease, but which do incorporate many of the latest refinements to Photoshop features.    Finally, the book deals with the essential techniques of equipment calibration and printing.    Although the book is primarily intended to be read while working with Photoshop CS4, the clear explanations of technique and the many illustrations combine to make it entirely possible to `follow along' without actually using the program -- a boon to those merely contemplating a purchase or upgrade.    As a carry-around companion exemplary in its conciseness and clarity, the book ideally suits two groups of photographers:    Those new to Photoshop or merely contemplating the latest upgrade need to understand whether the new features offer useful improvements to their present working environments, and whether the essentials are capable of being mastered with reasonable effort.    Professionals and enthusiasts who upgrade as a matter of course may too easily fall into the trap of simply working out how to follow their normal workflow in the changed environment, and may never discover the real benefits of changing that workflow to fit a new paradigm. This book will encourage them to invest just a little learning time in order to significantly improve the efficiency and consistency of their work.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

I was swayed by the many positive reviews, but in the end wasn't satisfied with the read.  I'm not a paranormal fan, but that part of the story didn't bother me.  It was the mechanics and conclusions that did.<br /><br />Pros: Intriguing concept.  Imagine living in your grandparents or great-grandparents time.  The book does a good job of painting a pretty realistic picture of the hardships, attitudes and advantages of an earlier time period.  I liked that it wasn't romanticized.  Conversely, imagine living in the future and trying to deal with unimaginable technology advances and a different belief system.  Not easy.  And again, the book does a good job of conveying the difficulty as well as the appreciation of some `modern' advantages.  Imagine living in a body and a life that isn't yours.  That was handled really well.<br /><br />I thought the author did a good job of keeping things straight in the different time periods and handling the discomfort the protagonist/s felt about a situation that seemed unbelievable, but to them was disconcertingly real.<br /><br />Cons: I found the pace uncomfortably choppy, with many sudden point of view changes that had me rereading a lot.  Some parts were covered in great detail and had a good engrossing flow, while others were glossed over so abruptly, I lost my concentration and often didn't retain that information well.  Consequently, when that tidbit was addressed later I had only the barest recollection of having seen it before, which jarred me out of the story.  It seemed as though the author wanted to include too much--more than was necessary to tell the story well.  Multiple very brief scenes seemed randomly stuck in almost as an afterthought.  Some had value, but most didn't.  I found that annoying, but perhaps those more attuned to the sound bite style of media today might not find it a problem.  In that regard, this book seems to have been written before its time.  It fits in better with today's preferences, which perhaps explains its resurgence of popularity.  I also wondered if the manuscript had been overly long and edited down to pre-defined size a little too ruthlessly.<br /><br />I found the ending unsatisfying.  There were loose ends everywhere and it was depressing.  Supposedly, the story was about the mirror, but it wasn't really, it was about the two women, who for unexplained reasons were treated differently by the mirror than everyone else.  I found the bits about the mirror incidental and unnecessary, as though there was conscious effort to make the story about the mirror when it wasn't.<br /><br />Obviously, to read other reviews, many really enjoyed this book.  Perhaps paranormal fans are more at home with how some things were handled.  Sadly, it just didn't work for me although I truly did find the concept fascinating, and read the whole book with interest (coupled with some confusion).

Dobbs' Approved","How can you not love a travel book where the very Prologue has the author being hunted at night by drunken locals for sport? Perhaps if some of the other writers out there had the same motivation the quality of writing in general might improve...but I digress. RICHARD GRANT's INTO THE LAWLESS HEART OF THE SIERRA MADRE GOD'S MIDDLE FINGER makes for interesting travel reading, the kind that has you wondering just what in the %$#@ was Grant thinking at times but leaving you glad that he went on his adventures and wrote about them and maybe even more pleased that you didn't have to. Mexico, if you are up on the news, is becoming an increasingly scarey place. Presently, it is on the State Department's TRAVEL ADVISORY list which means that officials in the know advise serious caution. It doesn't mean you shouldn't go but that maybe you need to be well aware of the possible dangers involved.<br />  The last time I visited one town south of the border the Chief of Police was gunned down in the street. Away from the popular resorts and into the interior the cocaine cowboys are alive and not acting well. Grant calls it like he sees it and that may annoy some, especially those in the tourist promotion trade, it might enlighten others who decide to venture into questionable areas with naive expectations. Granted: does Grant tell the typical traveler's tale? Probably not but there is enough valuable cautionary information to be had within its pages.<br />  God bless all mad crazy Englishmen and those who write from adventure experience, otherwise we'd be up to our collective back pockets in books by authors whose only heated close calls come from some yahoo with a cell phone spilling their coffee order in front of them at the coffee shop!<br />  This is a good first person account, good travel writing, good adventuring, and some good history tossed in as well. Mexico is a great place to visit and if you're going then it wouldn't hurt to read all of the good vacation info you can find prior to going, talk to folks who have been there, ask what they liked and what they didn't, and steer clear of the troubled spots.

Directions are trouble-free to track causing the resulting pieces to be very nice finished pieces.<br /><br />It was that beautiful cream and pinks lace stitch shawl on the cover that instantly caught my eye as I was walking by the rack where the book was on display. A quick check of pages led to purchase. Directions are offered on the left of a two page spread with a large full color photo of the finished piece on the right. It was a spiral lace capelet in delicate white, fringed geometric wrap for using up all those odd bits of yarn every needleworker has on hand, and gorgeous summer lace shawl edged in wide scallops that influenced me; this book provides patterns I will make and wear.<br /><br />Yarns listed for pieces are the high-priced ones, however, I learned long ago to replace with lesser dear yarns and adjust needle size and gauge accordingly with little effect upon finished pieces. I was right and I do like the capelet very much, it knitted up quickly, as I followed those easy to read instructions. I now look forward to making the lacey summer scarf during these long winter evenings.<br /><br />I find very handy that the patterns offered in the book are grouped according to function. The Table of Contents lists a variety of Wraps including stoles, shawls, shrugs and scarves. The eight patterns for ponchos and capelets are listed together as Perfect Ponchos. Included in the division is a one size fits all turtleneck poncho that is designed in uncomplicated stitches and can be made oversized for winter draping comfort. Ponchos with cowl necklines, made of rectangles, three with turtlenecks and a gorgeous chunky thread Aran knit that I know I will make as soon as I finish a fair isle piece, are all included in the poncho/capelet section.<br /><br />I especially like the threaded sherpa scarf and matching head hugging hat shown together as a matching set in the scarf section. The directions appear simple, and I'm anxious to get started on them.<br /><br />Offered for cold weather wear is an assortment of narrow draping scarves; some are plain knit, others feature cables, geometric designs, lace patterns or crocheted accents.<br /><br />A ribbed hooded cowl is a piece I will be making, my head gets cold when standing yard duty during the cold winter lunch hour. Hats are offered in simple seed stitch, ribbed, fair isle patterns, or even four having ear flaps.<br /><br />I enjoy knitting fair isle patterns and am happy to find a number of items offered in fair isle.<br /><br />The section titled His and Hers provides more fair isle work as well as more hats, scarves, geometrics, cables and knitting possibilities.<br /><br />Trisha Malcolm's well designed assemblage - Accessorize: Scarves-Hats-Ponchos-Socks & Mittens is packed with a satisfactorily rounded multiplicity of knit wear to stimulate the fancy of the most inveterate knitter.<br /><br />From a diagonal stitch handbag, to mittens and gloves, scarves, ponchos, hats, warm cable graced winter socks and even covers for golf clubs it will darn near impossible for knitters to NOT find something to tickle their fancy or get those knitting needles going.

I'm glad they didn't. It is a most excellent recipe book with a wealth of information on a difficult topic. The Armenians live in many host countries over a wide cultural range. Still, if we respect the opinions of Copeland Marks, he groups recipes of Holy Land Atmenians together with Armenians living in Calcutta. You cannot tell me that the same lamb recipe will taste exactly the same on two or three continents. So not being Armenian, with a mother, grandmother and great-grandmother from the homeland, I will blindly embrace Sonia Uvezian's authenticity as being representative of Aenian culture.<br /><br />In the weeks I have read this book, i find the recipes a unique and interesting expression of Caucassian cuisine. Similar in form to many food styles of Southern Russian and Turkey, these recipes however are individual and consistent in their use of flavorings; e.g. Lemons or lemon juice in many of the salads. I find it hard to believe that a good cook would produce boring and tasteless dishes following these recipes, although I have experienced home cooks that could turn most anything into a disaster.<br /><br />I particularly enjoy the incredible range and diversity of the recipes in this book. Sonia Uvezian's points frequently at which recipes or eating habits are uniquely Caucassian Armenian. Understandly, an Armenian who grew up in Greece might not be familiar with &#34;Keyma&#34;, as these are typically Lebonese, but I see nothing inauthentic on citing recipes that have been integrated into a regional cultural repertoire. We are all free to enjoy foreign delights! We would not be exploring diversified ethnic cookbooks otherwise. In short, this is a marvelous cookbook with tremendous range and depth. I am delighted to have it.","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

The book attempts to cover the whole epoch of Canada, from the French period to the almost present.  The book ends just before the events of 9/11 which would see Canada wrestling with difficulty to maintain a combat brigade in Afghanistan.<br /><br />The narrative moves along briskly with an almost tongue and cheek humor at times.  Much is covered, and much is also glossed over.  The book glances over the early parts of Canadian military military history and treads more slowly in the modern periods.  Here the reader will find himself bogged down in the trenches of acrimonious Canadian parliamentry debates over military budgets.  The book often loses track  with these endless discussions, which of course have importance of any such history as this, but which seem over emphasized.<br /><br />The narrative is highly critical of Canadian military administration and combat performance in both World Wars.  One wonders how Canada was able to do it with such a divided political opinion, and with the Canadienne always threatening to throw a wrench in things with Quebec's near constant disapproval of Ottawa.  The books shows the origins of Canadian Peace Keeping Missions in 1947, a source of much pride, but one which threatens to reduce the army to little more than a police service.  The combined services plan of the 1960s created almost as many problems as it was suppose to solve.  With modern weapons systems costing so much Canada perhaps wisely opted out of competing with other bigger nations, but the struggle to balance cost with efficiency never seems to work out.  It becomes harder and harder for Canada to maintain any kind of NATO commitment as well as do the Peace Keeping thing.<br /><br />The book becomes social history at times, while the chapters on the early military development of Canada are cursury at best.  Perhaps this is the best that can be expected for a book of this limited length, and like the subject that it discusses the final evaluation is somewhat disapponting, but good enough for a general read.and like the subject that it discusses the final evaluation is somewhat disapponting, but good enough for a general read.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

Though this news is clearly neither considered to be either astonishing or a hypothesis to members of the scientific community, it is certainly is such to the average layman.<br /><br />Considering the average level of scientific awareness, I think Crick has well positioned his book in the strike zone of ignorance.<br /><br />And so, when he says that our mind is created and altered by the physical features of our brain, that is news to most people.<br /><br />And there was a time not too long ago when it was news to the scientific community as well.  Perhaps no more dramatically was the point made than when, in the middle of the nineteenth century, a railway worker named Phineas Gage was placing explosive charges.  To Gage's misfortune, one of his charges exploded prematurely sending a metal spike through the front part of his skull.<br /><br />\\""After that,\\"" in an exteme understatement by a Gage co-worker, \\""Phineas wasn't the same Phineas anymore.\\""<br /><br />Where once there had been a thoughtful and sober employee, the new Gage (brain could actually be viewed through the hole in the top of his skull) became sullen and irratible...more prone to drinking than working.<br /><br />What was significant was the wound helped fuel the first truly modern theory about the workings of consciousness...viz. that they emerged from the brain and therefore could be changed by the brain.<br /><br />In fact, the one Nobel prize so far awarded in psychiatry (Munoz' 1949 achievement) came when doctors would remove the connecting tissue between the brain's hemispheres to reduce siezure activity (a remedy that now thankfully is achieved with drugs instead of such invasive surgery).<br /><br />And what doctors accomplish through treatment, Mother Nature accomplishes through natural selection.  Just like evolution impacts the development of limbs and internal organs and other anatomy, it also impacts brain development.<br /><br />While certainly all these developments can't help but throw cold water on traditional notions of a soul/body dichotomy, it nonetheless remains astonishing news to most members of the general public.  However, far from from making us feel more common and purposeless, it should makes us feel more lucky, that from a process that usually produces bacteria, bugs or at best meandering animals, that we've been given the opportunity to really understand (at least as best we can) nature and in so doing truly appreciate its beauty.<br /><br />What a pity it would be to walk through an art museum with our eyes closed or attend a symphony with our fingers in our ears.mplishes through natural selection.

Harlow Robinson gives the reader two biographical sketches . One biography centers upon the films and imagery of the Russian actors who portrayed certain characters, and then...a biography of the real actor, and the events in his or, her life.

The narrative is funny, moving, and sometimes painfully honest -- because this is a portrait not just of Nepal's northern frontier, but of Dr. Craig herself.

One quickly gains an appreciation for how the rapid pace of globalization is impacting individual lives in this former Himalayan kingdom -- a process by no means transparent to trekkers, or other short-term visitors. \\""Horses Like Lightning\\"" is a wonderful book.

And to abandon punctuation? As though such things were merely unnecessary luxuries from a time before the world was consumed in fire. Just more cloying components of the grey ash of literary convention that Cormac McCarthy seeks to sweep away with his writing. Oh, if only...<br /><br />In \\""The Road\\"", Cormac McCarthy portrays a world laid waste by some nameless catastrophe which has consumed all civilisation and destroyed most of the life on the planet. A man and his son journey through the lifeless and colourless world that remains, struggling to survive against the cold, the hunger, the sporadic wildfires and the ubiquitous grey ash that now fills the air, choking out the sun, blocking out the moon and stars, making even breathing a challenge.  And, of course, avoiding contact with other survivors like themselves, few of whom are likely to look upon them as anything other than the source of the next meal. One way or another. Following the road that they hope will lead them to somewhere -- or someone -- better.<br /><br />The book makes grim reading just about throughout, although there is less of it than it may appear -- the print is large and widely spaced and most readers will have it finished within a day of picking it up, I suspect. The only thing likely to slow anyone down is the author's affectation of abandoning the apostrophe and the quotation mark in his writing, making the frequent long sections of dialogue hard to follow in places.  Mostly, the book reads like a padded-out screenplay and, perhaps not surprisingly, the motion picture version of the story has already been made. I would imagine that it follows the book closely--which won't be hard given that nothing much happens--and I don't doubt that it will be every bit as grey and colourless as the book. And that viewers will sit riveted from beginning to end. And then go off in search of something to eat...<br /><br />As a novel, the story works less well, however, for it is not so much a story as a portrait. And although it is never less than engaging and remains believable throughout, with a few instances of quite prophetic insight, it nevertheless left me curiously unsatisfied.well, however, for it is not so much a story as a portrait.

I absolutely loved the plot, from the mystery and suspense to the sweet love story.  The fact that Mary and Jim knew each other in high school and that Jim had been infatuated with her best friend was a great back story.  It was interesting to see them get to know each other for themselves, instead of being in someone else's shadow.  I could really relate to Mary's quiet personality and her love of mysteries!  Jim was a great character, too, as he strove to do the right thing and was very thoughtful and honorable, but could be indecisive and slow to act when he should.  I admired both her and Jim's willingness to face their fears.  They both had traumatic events in their pasts and it was inspiring to see them strive to overcome them.  The faith element was great, as both Mary and Jim were strong believers, with plenty of prayer and trying to discern God's will.  I really appreciated how Jim struggled to be a good leader like Nehemiah, from the Old Testament.  There were lots of sweet romantic moments.  The mystery was interesting and there was definitely some action!  I liked learning about the tensions leading up to World War II in America;  I hadn't heard about that before.  It was also interesting to learn more about the Navy and what went on at the Navy yard and on the ships.  This is the start of a new series and I'm so excited!

The setting here is the main campus of the University of Texas at Austin.  Jennifer Cave, a wayward but nice girl from Corpus Christi, TX is brutally murdered.  The perp is an equally wayward but decidedly not nice quiff from Little Rock, AR Carlton Pitonyak.  There is a sense of dread early on. The reader may quickly realize that something horrible will happen to poor Jennifer.  A relentlessly negative portrayal of both UT and the city of Austin amplifies this effect of impending doom.  The later part of DH deals with how- or if- the spinning wheels of justice will close in on Carlton.  Authoress Casey definitely maintains reader interest far into DH, even throughout Carlton's trial.  Many such proceedings are cut and tried affairs in true crime land, but not here.  This reader was waiting for Carlton's lawyer to pull a rabbit out of a hat.  There are 2 minor sidebars to DH: The first is that Casey manifestly became very close to the Cave family, perhaps a tad too much so. The second is that the trail of justice actually crosses the Rio Grande into Piedras Negras, Mexico!  This reviewer was reminded of the quandary faced by John Wayne in \\""Rio Grande\\"".  How does the Law deal with that pesky flowing border?  The bottom line is that \\""A Descent into Hell\\"" is a winning true crime tale and a perfectly save choice for aficionados.   This reviewer is compelled to state that the \\""Ann Rule Rule\\"" is once again in effect. The centerfold photos and especially the back cover reveal too much.  Readers should ignore both until finished with the text.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

Both reviewers also seem oblivious to the fact that those of us who study the sociology of religion make a clear distinction between the \\""official\\"" teachings of the Church and the ACTUAL beliefs of REAL, PRACTICING, Catholics (in other words, the difference between Theoria and Praxis). Part of Ruether's \\""agenda\\"" is to help CLOSE this gap, while conservatives like Jeri and Bobby seem content to let this gaping incongruity stand just as it is.  They apparently see themselves as lay \\""Defenders of Correct Doctrine,\\"" taking over the current Pope's former job at the local level.     (That the reviewers see themselves in this light can be evidenced by Bobby's overly defensive declaration that \\""we\\"" have \\""nothing to fear\\"" from Ruether's book, as though she was going after lay Catholics, when clearly, as the title of the book suggests, the Magisterium is her target. Unfortunately, Bobby doesn't quite seem to realize that repeatedly calling something \\""ridiculous\\"" isn't really presenting a counter-argument, as I've told my own students time and again. Nor is suggesting that someone's position is \\""in league with Lucifer,\\"" a tired old trick that is so out of date it's really not even funny. Perhaps a course in Contemporary Reason and Argument would help!      Jeri fares little better, deciding apparently that he/she is \\""in charge\\"" of deciding who is or isn't a Catholic, and then proceeding under the GROUNDLESS ASSUMPTION that Ruether is an \\""outsider.\\""  Again, most sociologists of religion believe that religious affiliation is largely SELF-identifying, and thus, just because, say, the Church's governing body may consider someone to be \\""outside of the faith\\"" doesn't mean they suddenly cease to have a Catholic \\""way of being-in-the-world.\\""  In other words, to put it simply, a \\""Catholic\\"" is anyone who thinks of THEMSELVES as a Catholic, not someone who \\""blindly accepts a conservative interpretation of Church dogma and is considered a Catholic by Jeri.\\""  Again, if Jeri or Bobby understood the Theoria/Praxis distinction they would get this crucial point.  In any event, anyone who actually KNOWS Ruether knows that she identifies VERY STRONGLY with \\""being\\"" a Catholic, albeit a \\""progressive\\"" one.      BTW, anyone SERIOUSLY interested in this Vatican/Lay Catholic distinction should read Father Greeley's classic survey,[[ASIN:0684826828 The Catholic Myth]] ,  or the more recent essay collection edited by yet ANOTHER \\""uppity\\"" Catholic feminist, Elizabeth Johnson,[[ASIN:0824519795 The Church Women Want: Catholic Women in Dialogue]].)    This profound lack of understanding (of the gulf between the Vatican and Lay Catholics) unfortunately undermines any substantial criticism either of the the reviewers may have wished to toss Ruether's way, and instead shows them both to be clearly members of the \\""Out of Date, Traditional Catholics Society.\\"" By referring to a passionate call for major theological, social, ethical, and political change in the Church as a \\""leftist fad\\"", Jeri in particular shows that he/she CLEARLY fails to understand the gravity of the current world situation, and thus he/she can hardly claim to speak for \\""most\\"" of the world's \\""one billion Catholics,\\"" particularly those in the Global South.    And one more thing.  The \\""personal\\"" attacks on Ruether's \\""lack of knowledge\\"" of Catholic History and Doctrine? Weak, guys, really, really weak.  Ruether's an ESTABLISHED, world-class scholar, who has been writing professionally at least since the late '60's.  Jeri, Bobby, how many academic conferences have YOU two presented at?  How many peer-reviewed academic books and articles have YOU written that merit giving your positions the slightest bit of validity?    As someone who has actually STUDIED with Professor Ruether and has actually read ALL of her books, I can attest to the depth and breadth of her truly encyclopedic knowledge of a vast variety of subjects, INCLUDING, yes, Catholic history and doctrine.  So, guys, THAT line of attack is simply not going to fly with ANYONE who knows better.    I could go on, but I'll leave Ruether's bold, insightful clarion call of a book to stand for itself.    I know it's quite typical of religious conservatives to cling to \\""tradition for tradition's sake,\\"" so I really shouldn't be surprised by these viewpoints.  I guess I was just hoping for some more, well \\""novel\\"" opponents.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

I noticed a book cover that looked like a cross between Edgar Allan Poe and Agatha Christie. The book's cover depicts an ominous  cloaked-figure fronting a large eerie building in the background. The cover's stark, black and white detail contrast sharply with the blood-red title and certain aspects of the curious figure with the carefully concealed face. These set the stage for the book's overtones of dread and mystery that are reflected in the Agatha Christie-like title. I was hooked immediately.<br /><br />As an old X-Files junkie and a fan of Frank Peretti's novels of good versus evil, I began to read the novel's description and a few reviews. &#34;Secrets in the Shallows&#34; was exactly what I was looking for, and I was not disappointed. I thoroughly enjoyed the characters and the setting of a small fishing town and monastery on the stark New England coast. First in the Monastery Murders trilogy, the readers is quickly drawn into a paranormal murder mystery whose plot I will not divulge to keep future readers interested. But as the title implies, this is a suspense-filled story with death and eeriness  leading you closer to the secrets of the evil lurking here.<br /><br />Twists, turns and a cliffhanger ending will keep you turning page after page as you seek to solve the mystery yourself. With vivid descriptions and crisp dialogues, this is just the book for lovers of old time mystery and suspense. With the pending publication of the second novel,&#34;Devil in the Details&#34; set for late August of 2015, I feel as if I am awaiting a new Harry Potter novel with that same anticipation and excitement.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this paranormal tale of mystery and murder and highly recommend it to everyone who enjoys this genre or just a good, late night, escapist read.","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

A look through the bibliography and author notes shows a long list of newspapers, books and web sites, but not a single interview.

It would be difficult and illogical to try to review these two books separately, because they are clearly two halves of a single story and should be read as such.    With \\""The Hyperion Cantos\\"" Dan Simmons creates a layered and detailed civilization eight centuries in the future, one of the most stunning and multifaceted histories ever produced by an sf writer. The world of the Hegemony of Man -- a Web that spans the galaxy, connecting planets through 'farcasters' -- is at once incredibly advanced and reassuringly human. You can step through a farcaster portal and find yourself on a different planet, or access the datasphere via your own implanted comlog; at the same time, one of the story's protagonists plays Rachmaninoff on his piano, and drinks Scotch whisky. It is a futuristic world, but not one wholly out of touch with its own history.    To this world Simmons brings a story that is just as complex. There is an approaching war between the Hegemony and the Ousters, humans who have adapted to space travel and left the rest of us behind; there are artificial intelligences from the present and future plotting mankind's downfall; there are religious discussions and political machinations; there are copious references to the life and works of John Keats. There is a lot going on in this book.    Simmons' greatest feat is in never overwhelming the reader with all this information and plot. The story focuses largely on half a dozen pilgrims on the planet Hyperion, whose mission will decide the fate of the galaxy. The characters are believable and compelling, and it is their own backstories which form the bulk of the first volume. By structuring his story in this way Simmons is able to summarize nearly every trend in science fiction at once: among our heroes is Fedmahn Kassad, a war hero whose story will appeal to fans of military sf; Brawne Lamia, a private detective whose backstory reaches into cyberpunk territory; Sol Weintraub, a scholar trying to find a cure for his reverse-aging daughter. The protagonist of the second volume is a \\""persona\\"" of John Keats that has been recreated in a human body.    It is a giant of a book, daunting and all-encompassing. It took me some time to work up the courage to read it, actually. It is a masterpiece of science fiction, perhaps one of the greatest novels to address humanity's future and our place in the universe; yet it is also a deeply personal book.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

Haunted and inspired by the losses among his family and friends during World War II, he became a minister. He battled to make a difference, by fighting against a crime syndicate in Spring Valley, Illinois, and for racial justice in Alton, Rockford, and Chicago, Illinois. Eventually he retired to a place that has long been a home to his family, in Northport, Michigan.     \\""I have lamented,\\"" the author writes, \\""that my own father and mother never gave us many of the adventures, joys, sorrows, significant events and decisions of their lives.\\"" If you've ever thought of leaving your own story for those you love, \\""Confessions of a Maverick Minister\\"" will leave you inspired.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

The primary plot involves the incursion of the titular Plague Lords from Mexico into the Deathlands, using a human viral vector as their agent to soften the opposition before attacking.  The subtext to the primary plot is that the plague carrier is a 20th century hack author who used to write for a trashy pulp series of novels called Slaughter Realms, and there is more than just a hint of autobiographical backstory slipped in there.  Personally, I was thoroughly amused by the meta humor worked into the story.    That being said, the book definitely does not lack for action.  There is the high speed encounter with a pack of mating stickies.  There are the explosive dealings with a trader from Ryan and J.B.'s past.  And of course there is the pitched, running battle at the climax of the bookthat leads to the aforementioned cliffhanger.    Speaking of which, I don't recall any book in recent series history that actually ended on such a clear cliffhanger.  There  have been other duologies, but those stories tended to be self-contained episodes that were loosely related, whereas this reads as quite literally the first 350 pages of a 700 page story.  After so many years of lowest common denominator storytelling, it is refreshing to see a bit of a renaissance in the series.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

The answer is that the regulators were , in fact,opposed to the regulations that they were supposed to enforce.All of the regulatory agencies over the last thirty years have been stocked with believers in the  \\"" Efficient Market Hypothesis\\""(EMH).There is not a shred of empirical,historical,or statistical support for this theory ,which is practically identical to the artificially constructed models of Ptolomaic astronomy.EMH argues,on completely a priori grounds,that there can be no such thing as a speculative bubble because all possible relevant knowledge is known by market participants in the aggregate.There is no ambiguity,vagueness,unclearness,conflict in,or uncertainty in the information and data used by the market to assess prices.This leads inevitably to the claim that some version of the normal probability distribution is applicable.       Benoit Mandelbrot has demonstrated repeatedly ,since the late 1950's,that the time series data sets are not close to being normally distributed.The Cauchy distribution has a much better fit to the time series data on prices.N N Taleb has demonstrated,as J M Keynes did before him,that single ,unique events and infrequent events,which are endogenous to the financial and economic system,have at least as big an impact,if not greater, as frequent events do .There are no selections from these authors in this book.In fact,it appears that there is no referencesto these authors in any of the essays.Both Mandelbrot,starting in the late 1950's and Taleb,starting around the late 1990's, have made seminal contributions explaining the severe dangers of allowing Wall Street investment banks to engage in the speculative types of behavior discussed in this book.Hopefully,in a future edition,Lewis will rectify this lacuna and put in at least 2 -3 articles written by them.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

It just doesn’t make sense to me.  Too many Thee’s and Thou’s and references to things I just don’t understand.”  I’ve had this thought myself and I have heard it echo’ed in comments from my friends.  What do you do?  The Bible is an important part of our Christian faith.  It is important for us to not only read, but to understand what is contained between it’s covers.<br /><br />I started out reading the King James version, it was like reading Shakespeare to me.  Sounded beautiful, but made little sense.  Then I moved on to a Student Bible.  It has helped me study the scriptures but over the years it’s Study Notes and Personal Stories have become outdated (It still references ‘Cassette Tapes’).  It has been time for an “upgrade” for some time, but because I have had this particular Bible for so many years, I am reluctant to part with it.  My study notes, highlights, and even notes from friends are contained within it’s pages.  Since the scriptures haven’t changed over time, I have held onto it and just purchased outside books for study.<br /><br />“The Apologetics Study Bible For Students HCSB” is a new Study Bible for today’s Christian.  The HCSB was born of the need to have a Bible that reflected today’s English.  There is a great introduction in the front of the Bible that explains what the Holman Christian Standard Bible is and explains their translations philosophy and other important features. To learn more about the HCSB translation please visit their website.<br /><br />The within it’s pages you’ll find several features that will make your bible study easier and more fulfilling.  There is an introduction to each of the sixty-six books for the Bible.  This is one of my favourite features.  It gives you some insight into what is happening in the world at the time.  This helps me understand why people are acting the way they do and why certain things that seem insignificant to me are extremely important to the story.<br /><br />There are 120 Articles that deal with life’s tough questions, written by leading Christian thinkers.  Sixty Twisted Scriptures that show how and why people distort Christian teachings. I love when science proves that the stories in the Bible actually happened.  Explore some of these discoveries through the 50 Bone and Dirt features outlining archaeological discoveries. It also includes 20 Personal Stories to show us how God has worked in the lives of others and 20 Top Fives that are bullet points to help you remember significant apologetics topics.<br /><br />“The Apologetics Study Bible For Students HCSB” is a Bible that anyone would be proud to carry.  It has a hard-cover in brown tones.  It is something that anyone can use and will not go “out of style” in years to come.<br /><br />I do find the pages, like many other Bibles, very thin.  I haven’t tried highlighting any text in it, I am at the campground with no access to to a high-lighter, but I feel that the colours may bleed through.  I also find the pages a bit difficult to turn, but I believe that is only due to the fact that it is a brand new book and I haven’t had the chance to flip over each page.<br /><br />There are foot notes on virtually every page that help explain the scriptures.  I find myself referencing these more and more as I explore the Bible.  Each page is clearly numbered on the bottom and the upper corner contains the Book and starting/ending verse.  Each chapter is clearly number with large number and title, which helps you understand what you are about to read. They have also payed extreme attention to the line breaks.  I notice this the most in the Book of Psalms, where each line ends in a logical place instead of what sometimes seems random in other translations.<br /><br />I disliked the way the quotes are displayed.  They are inline with the text only differentiated by a font colour. I feel new Christians will find it difficult toimmediately tell if it’s scripture or a quote.  After using the Bible for a bit it will become easily identifiable but initially it may be confusing.<br /><br />“The Apologetics Study Bible For Students HCSB” is a great translation and an excellent resource using today’s English, while remaining true to the scriptures. Here is a small example of a verse we all know and cherish.<br /><br />“For God loved the world in this way: He gave His One and Only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life.”<br />John 3:16<br /><br />For me there are a few simple changes, but the meaning is still there in it’s entirety.  The HCSB also includes a footnote for this verse (and the next) which helps me to further understand it’s meaning.<br /><br />Disclosure (in accordance with the FTC’s 16 CFR, Part 255: “Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising”): Many thanks to Propeller Consulting, LLC for providing a complimentary copy of the product in exchange for this review.immediately tell if it’s scripture or a quote.

I think my favorite aspect is that Mr. Wolfe takes an 18-year-old female seriously.  It seems like in modern society, college girls have become so much of a stereotype or something that they're not that interesting to anybody except themselves (or hungry young men).  They are not a subject to be studied by sociologists; they tend to be dismissed.  But in this book, Mr. Wolfe takes this population seriously - perhaps more seriously than most girls that age take themselves - and writes an engaging story that will make you step back and think.    This book reminded me a lot of Curtis Sittenfield's PREP, which is a major compliment.  I also hear that I AM CHARLOTTE SIMMONS is being turned into a movie.  I'm skeptical that the movie will be able to come close to matching the book.  Mr. Wolfe has made this book so much more than some teenage love story, or coming-of-age saga.  It's a reflection of American culture, and how our culture impacts young females, from Seven jeans to the pressure to excel academically.  Personally, I feel like this book isn't meant to be played out by a Hollywood starlet in front of packed movie theaters.  To me, this book is meant to be digested slowly, thoughtfully.  Mr. Wolfe takes such a rare approach, that it should be savored.      2 thumbs up.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

But the enduring, weathered stones like those Dan Snow has touched and loved and understood are what I was really trying to get closer to.<br /><br />The book is a photographic collection of Snow's stone works, built with nothing but gravity and sensitivity to the stone. Well, and some major strength and cleverness and WORK!<br /><br />Snow tells us what inspired each stone work and how the work progressed. Within his writing, many sentences have the quality of poetry.

It is quite a simple-but-profound pleasure to read the book.<br /><br />Like stonehenge, these structures are works of mystery and art that will endure. The only one in the whole book that I think I might possibly be able to accomplish with a little help from my friends is the fire pit/star gazing circle, with its fire-reflecting/communion-oriented seats facing inward with their backs doubling as recliners to quietly ponder the stars.

It was almost an accident that the two even met, but when they did, Massengill was quick to remember the extraordinary influence that Blakey had on him. It was 1972 when Blakey self-published his first book of male nudes titled HE. It was a landmark event, for very few publishers at the time were interested in putting out a book of male nudes. The naked female was well accepted but the male body was still somewhat taboo. Blakey helped shatter that belief and paved the way for the many others that followed through the years, including Massengill.    Blakey graduated from the University of Tulsa, served a stint in the Army (where he bought his first camera at the PX), and later ice skated professionally for over a decade. He developed as a photographer throughout his military and skating career, often setting up darkrooms wherever he happened to be stationed. When he retired from skating in 1967, Roy moved to New York City and set up a studio and darkroom in his loft on Sixth Avenue. Over the years, countless men, including many celebrities, posed for him. It is this period of work that is presented in 70's Male Nudes. Massengill helped Roy in bringing 70's Male Nudes to publication, serving as both friend and editor. Now, thankfully, the whole world can again see that spellbinding studio work created by an artist who plugged away crafting a masterful body of work while the rest of the world lay hypnotized by Playboy.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

As a child of the sixties with a rebellious nature I found myself feeling uncomfortable following Dale Hammer's behavior.  Most likely that discomfort is felt because Dale's behavior is so genuine.    Mr. Hazelgrove has written a story for today.  In our world of foreclosures and bailouts we are reading about the Dale Hammer's of the world everyday.  Financially over extended and emotionally disconnected.      Just like life, ROCKET MAN affords us the opportunity to laugh at our shortcomings and to embrace our foibles. Mr Hazelgroove provides plenty of opportunities to laugh-out-loud.     Another reviewer mentioned ROCKET MAN would make a great movie.  I must agree this novel should be made into a movie.    ROCKET MAN was my introduction to William Elliot Hazelgrove and I am looking forward to reading his previous novels.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

It contains a CD, which has readings of two different stories, each in a with-page-turn-beeps and without-page-turn-beeps version, as well as a musical rendition of one of the stories by Sally Taylor.  (Note that the product does not include either of the books read on the CD).<br /><br />The music is pleasant.  The reading is well done and soporific as bedtime stories should be.  Both stories are decent (though not better -- \\""On the Night You Were Born\\"" makes very little effort to rhyme or scan and \\""It's Time to Sleep My Love\\"" succeeds in rhyming and scanning by lapsing into some real poetastric jargon).<br /><br />But I don't feel like I can give the whole package five stars, because it seems sort of useless to me.  It's short for a readalong CD (and you'd have to buy the books) or for a drive in the car, and you can't use it to put children to sleep because of all the beeps.

If he had called it “Virginiaville, I would have sworn he was writing about my mother and me.  Betty is in her early 90’s, is losing her mind (she is afraid she will forget the hymns she still plays on the piano in church), she won’t talk about her encroaching dementia, she is angry, and she doesn’t understand her gay son. The parallels are eerie. On the other hand, this well-written book reaches the universal as George and Betty are all too much like many gay children and their parents of a certain generation in the U. S.<br /><br />Interlaced with Mr. Hodgman’s praise song to his mother is his own story as well. He at thirty-five is a recently unemployed editor from New York who returns to Paris, Missouri for a short visit to his mother’s and winds up staying to take care of her. (Having spent two years in Warrensburg, Missouri teaching English at a college there, I can testify to and smile at the strange names that towns in Missouri are famous for, a list of which the author gives the reader in the first and second paragraphs of his memoir. I had a student from Peculiar, one place that he names although he left off one of my favorites, Nob Noster.) In Paris the most popular verb is “pray,” and graduates of the local high school cannot get into state universities because the school no longer offers a foreign language.<br /><br />Growing up in Missouri, Mr. Hodgman never cared for football (Betty made him go out for the high school team in an effort to make him fit in) although he liked the marching band. As a youngster he watched TV soap operas—“As the World Turns” and “Edge of Night”-- and read MODERN SCREEN and PHOTOPLAY. He knew he didn’t fit in exactly. As an adult in New York, he does way too many drugs but does get into rehab and has difficulty with relationships although he does not find himself tragic: “I may not have had a life partner or a bunch of kids. But I have had loves you can’t quite put a label on, though now I am reconciled to being on my own.” And I loved his comment (he has a great sense of humor) that  he does better with “insignificant others” than significant others.<br /><br />The passages in this engaging memoir that are just as moving and sad as the writer’s descriptions of his mother sinking into dementia have to do with how he, his mother and his father always danced around the gay issue. They just didn’t talk about it. George has avoided the topic because he is afraid that if he broached the subject about the elephant that is always in the room, that he might have lost the love that his parents (his father is now deceased)  had for him.  Here is a passage that will break your heart: “There is much we have said nothing about, and yes, it is too late now. I kept silent. I didn’t tell them who I was. They didn’t ask. We didn’t know what to do about me. She would have helped me, if she had known how. She just didn’t know. I didn’t know what to ask for. I was scared. So was she. We never broke open. It was too frightening and we all have paid the price. My father never knew all of who I was. I never gave him the chance.”<br /><br />But back to this strange and loving woman that Mr. Hodgman calls “mother.” Although age is taking everything away from her and she believes she has lived too long and is “taking someone else’s time,” she is still his mother.  He understands that. She read to him as a child (as my own precious mother did for me). Can there be a better tribute about a mother than this? “She gave me words.” Finally Mr. Hodgman summarizes what his mother ultimately means to him in words that will make your eyes burn if you are not careful: “I think I have survived because of Betty, more than anyone. I will never stop remembering my mother’s strength, her struggle to remember words, to hang on tothe world. I will always hear her at the piano, an old woman practicing, still trying to get it right, to find the right notes. . . We have sometimes struggled with words but I am Betty’s boy.” And as Mr. Hodgman fantasizes in the Epilogue of what his life will be like when he is old and in the “Liza Minelli ward at Villa Fabulosa, he concludes “and in the end, kindness is everything.”<br /><br />BETTYVILLE is a near perfect memoir about two less-than-perfect but deeply loving human beings. I cannot fathom the kind of reader who would not be taken by it.the world. I will always hear her at the piano, an old woman practicing, still trying to get it right, to find the right notes. . .

Martin's Dunk & Egg novellas, not only stays true to the originally written story but gives it life with fantastic renderings of all the characters, the locales, and the action.  Drawn by artist Mike S. Miller and livened by colorist Mike Crowell, &#34;The Hedge Knight&#34; gives both &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; book and show fans a great look into the history of the Seven Kingdoms by seeing the beginnings of two individuals, Ser Duncan (Dunk) the Tall and the future King Aegon (Egg) V, who impact the series even a century later.<br /><br />The story begins with Dunk burying his mentor Ser Arlan Pennytree before taking his arms and horses to the Tourney at Ashford Meadow in an attempt to win a place in a lord's house by winning a tilt and becoming a champion if only for a little while.  Unfortunately Dunk finds himself broiled in a family feud, but this family happens to be the dynasty of the dragonkings--the Targaryens.  Not only does Dunk find his temporary squire to be a Prince, but he punches and kicks Egg's older (cruel) brother Aerion which could either leave him dead or maimed.  Dunk's fate comes down to a unique form of trial by combat, which has ramifications not only for him but knightly families and the realm itself.<br /><br />Of the work surrounding the graphic novel itself, I can only praise the work of Miller and Crowell who not only brought into visual life Dunk and Egg but so many other historically important characters in very consistent way throughout the entire book.  It is hard to find fault with the work of these two men save with pointing out a few continuity errors, which unfortunately happen in every graphic novel.  If anything after viewing their work I'm tempted to find more graphic novel either man has worked on given the good quality of work each put in this book.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the &#34;A Song of Ice and Fire&#34; world and haven't gotten this book yet I recommend you get it; if you're a television fan of &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; I highly recommend you get this book to see how the ancestors of some of your favorite and least favorite characters interacted while also seeing the Targaryens on the throne.get it; if you're a television fan of &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; I highly recommend you get this book to see how the ancestors of some of your favorite and least favorite characters interacted while also seeing the Targaryens on the throne.","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

It is not by any means ground-breaking fantasy, however. The book is the first in a projected trilogy, and tells the story of an extraordinarily precocious boy whose family is killed and then goes out to seek the wrongdoers. Pretty standard. Any fan of fantasy knows, though, that plot is only one small part of the magic. Most of the artistry lies in characters and in world-building.    The Name of the Wind is told mainly in the first person, which is a departure from the norm for the genre. Through this narrative format, we learn a great deal about the main character, Kvothe- the way his mind works, his feelings and his reasoning- but we get very little insight into the other characters. I like the first person narrative as future-Kvothe seems to be a pretty fascinating person. However, teenage-Kvothe is the main character in the story, and he can get a bit tiring. Hopefully he does some quick maturing in the next couple of books. It wasn't that he was unlikable at all. He was just such a teenager- sometimes so cocky and arrogant and rude for no purpose, and sometimes so completely the opposite that you'd think he was a different person. But it says a lot about Rothfuss that he captured the age of his character so well!    The world-building aspect of the novel is where it fell just a little short for me, and I think this is due to the first-person narrative. We are limited to knowing only what Kvothe knows and sees and hears, and so we have no real scope of how large the world he lives in is or who the major players in it are. I only know what Kvothe decides to tell me. This can be extremely frustrating, but it also means that there may be many more interesting stories and folklore shared in the coming books- I hope so! What I have seen and heard of Kvothe's world is intriguing so far, but it is impossible to put together any of the parts into a cohesive structure. Meaning- I read the story and was interested by it, but Iam not entirely certain that I know what it is even about.    That said, I'm very happy to hear that the next installment in the series will be published in April so that I can continue learning about Kvothe and his world and his friends. I have a feeling the series will be one that holds my interest while I read it, though I am not quite sure if it is destined for my keeper shelf.    **A small but real annoyance with this book is that there are several typos.  I have a third edition of the Daw hardcover and there were many errors in it, which I found annoying and unnecessary.  I hope Daw cleans them up.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

He tells us right away that he came to live in Ireland because he has an Irish father. But the story starts when his father leaves the commune and his mother then raises Pepe to do the farming work. The jungle is close around them and the village is isolated, a mix of people and one generator and computer. Pepe has friends his own age but he loves a golden horse called El Dorado.<br /><br />Violent drug gangs come and shoot up the commune, and after a little while of such turbulence Pepe's mother decides she will leave and go with her son to a city where her mother lives. So we leave the primitive isolated life and Pepe has to say goodbye to his fine horse. Travel also has its hazards, including other drug gangs and plain bandits. The city is not an easy life as they need to work at basic kitchen jobs. Eventually Pepe's grandparents in Ireland hear the situation and pay his fare to visit them. Pepe once more gets a chance to be with horses and he hopes to gain work with them.<br /><br />Mainly we get a good sense of place and we can ask ourselves what we make of the wandering father, off in Canada trying to sell his music, or the grandparents willing to take in a boy they have never met. We can consider the terror of the drug gangs and vulnerability of unarmed farmers.  Pepe comes across as stoic and brave, not told very much by adults and trying to swap from Spanish to English. To me it seems possible that some of this is based on a true story, or a composite of such stories.<br /><br />I strongly recommend parental supervision for pre-teen readers.","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

It shows how Bryson decides to take on the immense task of completing the entire AT with absolutely no training, very little outdoor knowledge, and no equipment. Inexperienced with any long-term backpacking, Bryson decides to hike the 2,100 mile trail for no other reason but that it \\""Sounds neat!\\""   After buying hundreds of dollars worth of hiking equipment that he does not know what to do with, Bryson must convince somebody to hike with him. He finally finds Stephen Katz, a school friend who had been out of touch with Bryson for 25 years. Katz embodies everything that a determined hiker would not want in a companion, aside from comic relief; he is fat, profane, and easily frustrated. In addition to Katz, Bryson creates many other characters who are very believable and realistic, mainly because, well, they are real. Although the list stretches on and on as the book continues and the reader probably will lose track of them, numerous awkward, \\""Office-like\\"" characters appear in the book, and Bryson does a fantastic job on expanding on their quirks.   Bryson is able to describe the enchanting American Northeast with startling objectivity, as he recently moved back to the U.S. from England, and he shows very little bias in his descriptions. He also is able to make the reader feel as if he or she is really scrambling up and down an infinite number of mountains and suffering through every grubby dinner of noodles. Bryson is informal in addressing his mammoth of a hike, as made evident by the irreverent title, A Walk in the Woods. Bryson is almost too sarcastic when making fun of other, more hardcore hikers, and manages to make the entire history of the AT sound like a bunch of bickering and crushed dreams. Occasionally, his descriptions can transform into rambling that take dozens of pages to get back to his actual hike. In themidst of his picture of how nature truly is, unfortunate descriptions of restaurants and trail-side shelters take top priority. After a few pages of true outdoors, Bryson begins to go on and on about how much he wants to get back to civilization.   Although A Walk in the Woods starts with a rush of anxiety and preparation, the tempo begins to slow down, just like in a real hiking trip, as the hike continues, and the story becomes a blur in the reader's mind. Bryson's account is not so much a nature-book as a comedy, and any hardcore hiker would do well to stay away from the irreverence of the woods that is commonplace throughout Bryson's descriptions. He manages to make fun of all hikers with the latest equipment (he presents Mary Ellen as an annoying gear-snob), conservationists (Katz throws trash and gear into the woods), and through-hikers. Bryson does not appear too concerned even when his sacred quest to complete the trail suddenly becomes much harder to obtain. He simply takes every easy way out of his crusade he can.   Bill Bryson, in his less-than-flattering account of hiking, A Walk in the Woods, mixes a good amount of humor in his first-hand account of the outdoors. Although his descriptions can sometimes become unbearable and the storyline drags along, Bryson's numerous humorous interjections about Appalachian Trail society lighten a fundamentally tiresome hike. His characters, based on actual people whom Bryson accoutered on the hike are very believable and funny. Although his story begins to crawl along towards the end, Bryson's objective and irreverent approach to hiking will entertain all but the most conservative of hikers.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

His intention is to assess critically what he calls a ominous class of trendy books that tends to rear its unsightly head from time to time.<br /><br />Having read the preface; I set out to examine the book itself.<br /><br />Chapter 0 is The Pustulates; in which the writer sets down what he views as the theories upon which Deepak Chopra bases his manuscript Ageless Body, Timeless Mind in addition to being the focus for many of his later works.<br /><br />Chapter - 1 titled: The Negation in which writer Damien is persuaded that statistics used aimed at mass consumers in the US are an endeavor to deride us. In addition, Chapter 1 brings the reader information for Writing (Dirty) Secrets.<br /><br />I found the chapter to be filled with a touch of the whimsical as the writer offered a series of words to learn by heart but not to necessarily comprehend in order to generate what he calls - guru type sentences - to 'grab the reader's attention by sounding as though a great, mystical concept is being put forth that could change the reader's life'. Damien says to become a guru; writers will need to develop a compilation of words to use. Whether the writer understands them is not important however. Writer Damien even offers some suggestions for writing self help books including a note that qualifications for doing so are actually none.<br /><br />Reading through Help, it became evident that Author Damien has found a recent tome offered by author Rhonda Byrne to be particularly troubling. Damien states unabashedly that Byrne and Chopra are his main targets, Chopra because in the notion of Damien he is an amalgamation of Dr Fritjof Capra and Dr Scott Peck. Damien says where fitting, connections to Byrne's resent book are posited.<br /><br />Other chapter titles include 2 Insect Nation, 3 Damien's Laws to combat the Seven Choprasin Laws and 4 The Three Tenors. Chapter 5 entitled The Guru talks of the Placebo Effect, and Originality, while Chapter 6 touches on Deadened Buyers. Chapter 7 wraps up the work with Final Thoughts before listing appendices, 4, and listing a group of notes prior to the bibliography.<br /><br />I'm not sure how much sincerity Writer Damien intended readers would share while reading his book Help!: Debunking the Outrageous Claims of Self-help Gurus.

Here are some takeaways but most were not new to me.<br /><br />1. GET OUT! In the vast majority of the disasters the author recounts, those who survived didn't freeze, didn't take time to gather their belongings and didn't listen to authorities telling them to stay put. They immediately GOT OUT--whether it be a sinking ship, a fire or a terrorist attack.<br /><br />2. Everyone reading this is a first responder--whether you have training or not. We are the ones who will have to make decisions in the moments before the professionals arrive. In major disasters like tsunamis or hurricanes, the professionals may not arrive for several days.<br /><br />3. Don't be courteous in a disaster. People tend to be unusually courteous and gallant in disasters, letting others go first. This can waste valuable time. Again, just get out.<br /><br />4. Drills are extremely important and shouldn't be taken lightly. You don't want to have to do too much thinking in an emergency. Practicing over and over again will help you get out quickly.<br /><br />5. When you stay in a hotel, always take the stairs after checking in so you know where they are. Don't use an elevator in an emergency.<br /><br />6. On a plane, pay attention to the safety instructions and read the card in the seatback in front of you. Professional disaster experts do this EVERY time they fly. They know every plane model is different.<br /><br />I couldn't find the accompanying web site promised by the author, just a few blog posts. I also didn't like the author's &#34;anecdote within an anecdote&#34; method of writing. Made it very hard to get practical tips. On the positive side, I commend the author for the hands-on research she did (extreme driving school,flight simulation, etc.). This might be a good read for people who like nonfiction thrillers like &#34;Into Thin Air&#34; by Jon Krakauer.","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

Her stories feature hate, heartbreak and the ugly realities that so much of life is comprised of and yet we cannot help gloss over or avoid in our escapist world. Jennifer Brown takes the agony of events and make them real. She doesn't let her readers move away, distant themselves from the pain of her characters. After reading the Hate List and meeting Jennifer Brown at Less Than Three, it was clear she was no stranger to pain and yet she's conquered her own rough start which is why I think she manages to write these kinds of realistic fictional YA stories without ever feeling overbearing or apathetic.<br /><br />I cried for nearly this entire book -- out of sorrow, out of rage, out of determined hope on Jersey's behalf. She loses the only people in the world who love her and instead of banding himself close to her, her stepfather who has been around her all her life pawns her off onto her paternal father who has had and still doesn't have an interest in building a relationship with his traumatized daughter. Her life upturned by death, Jersey Cameron faces life without any support and attempts to cope, deal, and repair after being broken so completely by the loss of her mother and stepsister.<br /><br />The emotional turns of this book, draw you in. A fast read despite the heaviness of the narrative. One of those reads, you should appreciate because it reminds us of the survival game that life really is and how humanity manages to triumph despite the worst scenarios.","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

And to abandon punctuation? As though such things were merely unnecessary luxuries from a time before the world was consumed in fire. Just more cloying components of the grey ash of literary convention that Cormac McCarthy seeks to sweep away with his writing. Oh, if only...<br /><br />In \\""The Road\\"", Cormac McCarthy portrays a world laid waste by some nameless catastrophe which has consumed all civilisation and destroyed most of the life on the planet. A man and his son journey through the lifeless and colourless world that remains, struggling to survive against the cold, the hunger, the sporadic wildfires and the ubiquitous grey ash that now fills the air, choking out the sun, blocking out the moon and stars, making even breathing a challenge.  And, of course, avoiding contact with other survivors like themselves, few of whom are likely to look upon them as anything other than the source of the next meal. One way or another. Following the road that they hope will lead them to somewhere -- or someone -- better.<br /><br />The book makes grim reading just about throughout, although there is less of it than it may appear -- the print is large and widely spaced and most readers will have it finished within a day of picking it up, I suspect. The only thing likely to slow anyone down is the author's affectation of abandoning the apostrophe and the quotation mark in his writing, making the frequent long sections of dialogue hard to follow in places.  Mostly, the book reads like a padded-out screenplay and, perhaps not surprisingly, the motion picture version of the story has already been made. I would imagine that it follows the book closely--which won't be hard given that nothing much happens--and I don't doubt that it will be every bit as grey and colourless as the book. And that viewers will sit riveted from beginning to end. And then go off in search of something to eat...<br /><br />As a novel, the story works less well, however, for it is not so much a story as a portrait. And although it is never less than engaging and remains believable throughout, with a few instances of quite prophetic insight, it nevertheless left me curiously unsatisfied.well, however, for it is not so much a story as a portrait.

It is definitely worth finding a cheese shop that either carries, or will order, burrata imported from southern Italy or made domestically by the Gioia Cheese Co. in South El Monte, CA. The book includes recipes for making some of the more difficult-to-find ingredients at home where possible.<br /><br />Great cookbook, great restaurant.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

Also a fan of Diana Galbadon's \\""Outlander\\"" books, I was looking forward to a contemporary Scottish tale - and JP delivered in the first 3rd of the book. Her descriptions of a modern Scottish village in America - Wheelock, first noted as \\""Wee Loch\\"" in a letter by the original settler, meaning \\""small lake\\"" - was spot on. But as the story progressed, I found myself wondering, \\""Where is she going with this?\\""<br /><br />There were several aside stories that remained unexplored - Cam's mother's New Age style is talked about in depth, and then just dropped; the whole war-dream-field thing was talked about several times but didn't ever time into the current story.<br /><br />Allie was a sucker, plain and simple. While I, as a wife, empathised with the ideas of 60/30 and wishing someone would notice how much you put into the daily work of relationships and love, I also felt like slapping her a couple of times. When she *** SPOILER ALERT *** finds Mia's underthings in Cam's drawer & marks it off as just a laundry fluke, I wanted to scream at this woebegone lady. Your assistant's [...] in your husband's drawer, and you say \\""if it's soft, I assume it's boxers?\\"" Yeah... No.<br /><br />Cam. Well. Cam. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to interpret the \\""letters\\"" as being to Allie or to Mia, but either way, Cam is a supreme jerk. There are so many ways in which I could outline this creep's faults, but I'll stop at saying that if my girlfriend called me and shared a similar story, my first words would not be \\""garage sale.\\""<br /><br />Mia. Strange character, JP didn't really elaborate much into her psyche (a big surprise after 19 Minutes & 10th Circle, in which you felt like you were the character during the story). In the end, I had zero sympathy. Her devotion to the cat, Kafka, was an indicator of her personality: unable to commit, unable to even ponder consequences.<br /><br />All in all, a good story but not in the Picoult Hall of Fame. My gold standard for JP is 19 Minutes, and she's reached it time and again with her wonderful stories - but Mercy wasn't one of them. A mediocre story by a fantastic writer, however, is 1,000x better than a good story from a mediocre writer.t Hall of Fame.

I was interested in seeing what Max Lucado had to say again.  I have been a fan of a lot of his work in the past because his writing is very easy to read.  For These Tough Times was no different.  The 80-page book was a very easy read.<br /><br />For These Tough Times tackles the questions that many people hold inside: Where is God when bad things happen?  Does God care?  Does God hear my prayers in the difficult times?  Lucado, as a minister, has heard the cries of people like this often and put together a good work to help shed some light on these subjects.  This work does not seek to fully answer each question, but it does give a good starting point for each question.  The tone of the book seems more like a conversation that one is having with Lucado over a cup of coffee.  Lucado does a great job of using everyday illustrations to make the Scripture he uses come to life for the situations that arise.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to those who are looking for some answers to difficult times that one may go through.  This work will bring encouragement and insight to any difficult situation.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

It is filled with truisms and insightful observations.  The author clearly has been there - and not in a clinical sense - but in a real world in-your-face all politics aside public school system sense.  No matter the state - no matter the \\""gifted\\"" program in your school - no matter how the classroom teacher is \\""differentiating the curriculum\\"" - you must read this book!  If you suspect that your child is bored in school regardless of the accommodation in the gifted program - you must read this book.  If you have a child with other exceptionalities who is being treated by his school as less than average in spite of having a photographic memory - you must read this book.  If you have a child or grandchild who you suspect may be gifted - read this book!  And if you are a teacher and have ever had or expect to have a gifted student, you definitely must read this book!    As I continue to experience the world of gifted education in schools across the state of Ohio I have my own longitudinal data to draw from.  I have seen children literally fall off the map and been astonished at how many gifted children become unproductive adults - dropping out of high school, self-medicating in their misery of not belonging in an average world, or worse, leaving this world because it seems to offer them nothing yet expects everything from them.  Giftedness has more to do with the way you learn and process information and I am so glad that someone has taken the time to explain this!  The label \\""gifted\\"" is highly charged and quite misleading - perhaps this book will open the discussion and help parents and educators understand what has taken me a lifetime - that high ability is not a \\""gift\\"" or a \\""special favor from God\\"" - or an unearned honor.  When we talk about giftedness we are really talking about a learning style and the way the brain processes information.  Using the term \\""gifted\\"" to describe high ability is like using the term \\""cursed\\"" to describe low ability.  You would never do so!  When parents and adults understand that accommodations are necessary to support learning for that particular child - then the student's needs are met and the risk of losing that student to underachievement are minimized.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

Maynard lays out a detailed case for not only how Detroit lost its hold on the auto industry, but the leadership philosophies that have made Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan and BMW such dominant and growing forces in the industry.    His case again Detroit begins with a case study of how Ford let the Taurus, once a leader in its class of cars, languish while pursuing pick-up trucks and high-profit SUVs. He makes a strong case that in their pursuit of short-term profits, Detroit's Big Three ignored the car market and the basics of putting quality talent against all of their models.    But the most interesting part of the book for me concerned his look into the leadership philosophies that have made Toyota and Honda such dominant forces in the industry. This section is a wonderful study of leadership in general and would make the book worth reading even if one could care less about cars. His outline of Toyota Development System and Honda's operating philosophy are well articulated and detailed.    This book has something to offer everyone and should be read by anyone interested in the auto industry, leadership and business.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

Yes, the author's use of cultural references was a bit too much, but it did not take away from the story itself, which keeps building and and pulling you in the further you read.  I read the last 100 pages in one evening because I could not put the book down (and as the parent of a young child, I generally take any opportunity I can to catch a few zzzzzs).  When I finished the book, I started flipping back through it to see where certain clues hinted at the ending (in retrospect).      You are left with genuine feelings for Blue (our heroine), and unlike most novels, everything is not tied up in a neat box.  People can use their imagination to fill in the blanks, which makes each reader's experience a bit different.    All in all, a very enjoyable read.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

Months later came a popular uprising and then the Soviet Union's invasion during December, 1979.<br /><br />More than 5 million fled, and another 1.5 million died before the Soviets left in 1989; then another 50,000 were killed in the struggle over Kabul, and still another 3,000-4,000 during the U.S. attack on the (Sunni) Taliban.<br /><br />Kabul has little control over the countryside compared to the warlords. Six major ethnic groups dominate, and complicate governance. In addition, Pakistani fundamentalists infiltrate rural areas, inciting violence, and the country is further torn between liberals and conservative-minded Islamists.<br /><br />Living conditions in the countryside are much worse than in Kabul. One Northern province has a 6.5% maternal childbirth death rate, one of the world's highest. One-fourth of children never reach age five. Some large areas with several hundred thousand inhabitants have no doctors.<br /><br />Afghan security forces are more likely to act in support of local warlords than Kabul. Warlord funding considerable benefits from claiming customs and road tax proceeds - up to $1,000,000/day.<br /><br />\\""The World of High-Tech Surveillance\\"" reports that the U.K. has over 4 million CCTV cameras monitoring the public. In France, 12 large machine eyes monitor deep underwater swimmers in a pool, programmed to recognize swimmers not moving in a way they're supposed to - the article also notes how they set off an alarm over a drowning swimmer that had not been noted by guards.<br /><br />Border agents use night-vision goggles, infrared light, and motion sensors.

I also think this would be a great book for undergraduates and perhaps even high school students because they are going to inherit the messes we leave behind, and I hope that being aware of the issues at hand will help to remedy the devastation of the anthropocene. I've had discussions about some of the issues with younger students, and i like to believe that the sooner we get to the youngsters the better off their and our lives will be.

All opinions are my own and in no way influenced by the author or publisher.<br /><br />“Wolves of the Northern Rift” is a breath of fresh air. I expected this to be along the same lines as most other werewolf novels, full of eternal love and teenage angst…maybe a little different coming from the mind of a male author. So I was very pleasantly surprised to discover this was a much more grown up werewolf book than I have encountered before. Picture: Sherlock Holmes meets Mistborn Trilogy (by Brandon Sanderson).<br /><br />This story feels like you are in 1800s Britain with Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. However it is an imaginary world whose king has a fear of magic and magical beings. The Royal Inquisitors were created to investigate rumors of magical creatures in the land, and if true, destroy those creatures, every last one. Protect the kingdom from magic at all costs is their mission. Royal Inquisitor Simon Whitlock and his friend, scientifically-minded Mr. Strong, head to the arctic tundra to look into rumors of werewolf attacks. Expecting yet another charlatan, they couldn’t know their investigation would take them into battle against a far more terrifying enemy with surprising allies at their side.<br /><br />We all love YA paranormal/science fiction. You do to or you wouldn’t be checking reviews on a book about werewolves. YA unfortunately most often follows the same prescribed MO: teenage forever love, love triangle, teenage drama, teenagers must save the city, the world, the universe because for some reason experienced, mature adults cannot. You know what I’m talking about. That’s where this one was so refreshing. FINALLY, I felt, a paranormal book for grown-ups. No insult intended to books written for a younger audience, but as a grown up sometimes you get tired of books that make you roll your eyes. But you have to read those books to get your paranormal fix, lol!<br /><br />Jon Messenger does a great job fleshing out this story. Lots of mystery involved. Great action scenes that feel like straight out of a movie. Great comedic banter between the leading male characters. Just a hint of romance. And no “drama”. Just an all-around great story that leaves you intrigued, chuckling, and ready for book 2 (and perhaps a Sherlock Holmes movie).br /><br />Jon Messenger does a great job fleshing out this story.

He also throws in a number of helpful tips on how to get your foot in the door and how to finagle your way around having almost no budget.<br /><br />For me, the problem was that this info-- how to save money by making a film for almost nothing-- was by far the major focus of the book. There was proportionally very little info-- and the info there was was quite superficial-- on the creative makings of a film. To the limited extent that he did mention hands-on film-making techniques, much of the info was outmoded because the book is by now more than 10 years old, and by now film-making technolgies have changed dramatically.<br /><br />Long story short: this is an approachable beginner's guide to no-budget film-making.

Meanwhile, billions of international dollars have poured in to bolster its new democratic government and rebuild the nation essentially, after three decades of conflict, from scratch.  Thousands of US soldiers and their allied counterparts have flowed in and out of the country.  Hundreds of Taliban and al Qaeda militants have been captured or killed.  Innumerable NGOs have come and gone.  Still, the generous contributions of blood and treasure have not prevented the country from a very dangerous upsurge of insecurity and a reemergence of Taliban and al Qaeda.      This frustrating situation poses some fundamental questions for those who are familiar with Afghanistan.  Why are innocent Afghans still dying daily at the hands of the Taliban?  Why are so many still financially destitute?  Why are al Qaeda and Taliban militants still on the march?  More specifically, why has violence spread into areas once considered 'secured' such as Herat and Kabul?  In essence, after so much time and money spent and so many lives lost, why hasn't the Afghan problem been settled?  'After the Taliban: Life and Security in Rural Afghanistan' attempts to answer these questions and many more.    For the first time, data presented in 'After the Taliban' brings to light the gap in perceptions between the international community and rural Afghans as the underpinning cause for policy failures in Afghanistan.  'After the Taliban' demonstrates the international community's understanding of security in Afghanistan is vastly different from local understandings of security.  The international perspective is primarily physical with emphasis on the number of attacks against UN, international NGOs, US/NATO, and the Afghan government.  The local perspective, on the other hand, is primarily human security, which includes physical security, with emphasis on food, shelter, clean drinking water, basic infrastructure such as roads and schools, and jobs.  Data presented in 'After the Taliban' validates both perspectives; however, it argues they are disconnected.  This disconnect is a serious problem.     What can be done?  'After the Taliban' argues for understanding the gap between international and local perspectives of security.  This entails systematic efforts to address this divide by building complementary relations between the two perspectives at both policy and program levels.  Building national security forces and a stable capital city, for instance, are very important to the future of Afghanistan.  Indeed, they are vital.  Equally critical are a functioning education system, employment opportunities, and improved roads.  Good education, as with any nation, is the key to Afghanistan's current and future generations.  To develop local capacity demands cadres schooled in democratic leadership and progressive entrepreneurship.  Jobs will keep young men gainfully occupied.  This derails radicalization which grows out of hopelessness in dysfunctioned societies and prevents scores of youths from participating in the ongoing insurgency.  Roads, for instance, permit movement of goods to market: an essential requirement for economic development.  They facilitate reconstruction into remote areas as well.  Seeing and understanding things from the local point of view offer greater effectiveness and legitimacy to the US-led international intervention in Afghanistan.            Afghanistan is a complex issue yet to be settled.  To improve the current effort, reading 'After the Taliban' is a great start and is highly recommended to policy makers and `movers and shakers' of current stability programs in Afghanistan.  In addition, 'After the Taliban' offers profound data resources and arguments that are significantly valuable for those dealing with post conflict stability and peace building programs.  Last, 'After the Taliban' offers added value to the discourse within social sciences especially inthe areas of gender and conflict, culture and politics, the role of livelihood development in peace building, and the democratization process.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

According to the author, though there are still many problems in Africa, there is much hope that the continent will become the next India over the next two decades, hence the title \\""Africa Rising\\"". Many companies have been started in Africa and, I was heartened to find out, some of them by Africans themselves. I think that it would not represent progress if all business in Africa came from outside the continent, ie. from the West or the East. It is important that Africans themselves have a stake in their future for this is the only way for them to maintain their own welfare.<br /><br />The author divides the African people into African One, 5 to 15 percent of the population, who represent the rich of Africa. These people live well and are avid consumers. They frequently employ members of Africa Two, which consists of 35 to 50 percent of the population. These people are like the lower middle class of America. While they do not have much money they represent a much larger group than Africa One. Finally Africa Three is the group we in the West read about regularly in the press. They are very poor, but even here the author finds room for hope; their need for basic infrastructure is an opportunity for any company that can provide them with it. All in all, I like the author's positive outlook and hope that he is right in his conclusions.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

One interesting one is about the Bhastrika pranayama, which I have seen is done in two ways by various teachers. One is pure abdominal breathing and the other is thoracic breathing. Gregor Maehle with his convincing line of arguments proves that Bhastrika is indeed thoracic breathing technique and my long-term confusion about it was solved.<br /><br />Another interesting thing I learnt was, one could achieve kevala kumbhaka with prolonged kapalbhathi practice. I used to get this spontaneous kumbhaka effect with very long kpaabhathi practice and was always surprised if it was a good or bad effect.

The prospect of revisiting a time where individual games had meaning and players didn't bolt for the NBA after their freshman year seemed inviting, so I ordered Seth Davis's book.<br /><br />I'm old enough to have watched Bird and Magic play in championship game that is the subject of the book.  I also generally appreciate the importance of the game to college basketball.  However, I was surprised how much I had either forgotten or not known about this epic clash.<br /><br />Davis's book is a detailed account of the season and games that led to the Indiana State-Michigan State match up in the 1979 NCAA finals. The game-by-game descriptions and anecdotes that you would expect are all here (sometimes in more detail than needed).  Where Davis's book really shines is in taking us inside the backgrounds of the protagonists to uncover (especially with Bird) some of what made each player tick.  I also appreciated learning more about the supporting players on each team.  Pictures of the players and team are curiously missing from the book.<br /><br />When March Went Mad is best suited for avid fans of college basketball or those wanting to know a little more about the early rivalry of Bird and Magic.  I passed the book along to my 16-year old son in the hope that he could find value in those \\""old guys with the little shorts\\"".

By the age of 11 she was blazing through Inkheart or Aragon within a week's time.  This book would be little more than a bedtime story for her, and probably wouldn't hold her interest.  But I don't think she is the target audience for this book.<br /><br />This series could be a great way to introduce \\""reluctant readers\\"" in the 13 to 16 age range to a lifetime of enjoyable and successful reading.  Several reviewers of this book mention younger readers - 10 to 12 years old as being a good target audience, and I have to disagree with them.  From a stylistic and approachability standpoint, they are right, but there is a bit of \\""teenage\\"" content dealing with romance (16 year old Daisy and her boyfriend Ryan kiss in the hallways at school, whisper to each other that they \\""can't wait to be alone together\\"" when planning an evening at Daisy's one night while her single Mom is working late, and do a bit of mild groping on the porch swing).  As a parent, I didn't find the content to be offensive; it was very tastefully written, but it is a subject that iI don't want to push on my 12-year old daughter (she'll get there soon enough on her own and I don't want to speed the process!)<br /><br />The relationships between the sisters, their friends, and their parents are very realistic, and I think most kids in this age range will instantly relate to one or more characters.  There are no negative stereotypes that jumped out while reading the book, and other than the relatively mild teenage content I mentioned, one should have no concerns having their kids read this book.  In fact, there is probably some good fodder for discussions between single Moms and their tween daughters living between the pages of this book and its other siblings in the series.<br /><br />All in all, a pleasant if predictable story that reminded me a lot of classic Nancy Drew, but updated with modern issues like having a single Mom, cell phones and texting, and the role of women in today's world (as opposed to the 1950s).

The text is largely on the right side of the page, while illustrations and quotations appear on the left side of the page.  The leading between the lines of text and the expansive white space around the text makes for a very lean, very thin  reading experience.<br /><br />The Law of Seven (Gurdjieff) parallels the Pythagorean Octave or Apollo's Seven-String Lyre.  The Law of Three parallels the Greek tripod of Delphi.  The author presumes these parallels are identical, but without explaining what any of these terms truly means, except in the most recondite manner.<br /><br />In case you're not sure you got the essence of the book, on pages 59 and 61 (right-hand pages), the author has produced a Summary, which encapsulates the previous 57 pages of vacuous assertions.<br /><br />The author throws in some other ideas that man is divided, as Gurdjieff stated, and asserts that Hercules being torn apart as a goat parallels Gurdjieff's idea or is, in fact, the same thing.<br /><br />Finally, the author answers that knowing what the Greek roots are to Gurdjieff's system allows him to appreciate the Roman Catholic Church's architecture (not the Mass) and quotes something from the writings of Pope Benedict XVI that seems to portray the pedophile-protecting leader of the church as having some understanding of Pythagorean octaves.","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

For one, spirit is synonymous to conscious energy, how that could be missed by Dr. Ball is laughable.  I also had a problem with his assumption towards other ppl's experiences of ufo and alien phenomena, in most recorded cases of either, no ppl ever mention tripping on DMT or any other mind altering drug for their experiences even when they passed a polygraph test.  Dr. Ball would have one to believe or at least accept his arrogant view that humans are the highest degree of God intelligence in the universe because of his experience with DMT tripping.  Sure, ppl can lie about their experiences but then again Dr. Ball cannot verify who's lying or speaking the truth as he wouldn't know most of the ppl personally that he may feel is just caught up in delusional fantasy.  But, the same can be said about his interpretation of absolute reality as he admits to using DMT to induce his aha moment.  So what!, if DMT is produced by the body, so is serotonin, but receiving injections of it doesn't make anyone a messiah in the real world.  It's not late breaking news that all things are related to what is called God, this particular view has always been expressed by ancient spiritualist as well as those of today.  I actually liked the beginning part of Dr. Ball's book about showing the connection between Creator and creation, but he dropped the ball ( p. i. ) when he gave the weak claim of physical reality as we know it as being the only individuated reality with no subtler hierarchy.  Physicist now know that this is not so, why Dr. Ball is still in the dark on this may be of his own doing.  I have personally been communicated by passed relatives, I have seen ufo's and other phenomenon's without the aid of any mind altering drug, be it natural or synthetic...  Dr. Ball's interpretation of The All is very sloppy, rushed, and not well thought out in my opinion.  I was really expecting something new, but it's just the typical spin that the author must weave to sell his book...  What we see and accept as divine truth may not always be the truth.  One should understand that the reality of creation is the deception of artificial inverted as actual reality...  Dr. Ball believes that God and ego are one and the same because of the obvious connection of there being no true separation...  I see for Dr. Ball that sounds very comforting but he obviously missed some key things about the reality of so-called GOD...  but maybe if he increases his DMT dosage he will get the proper realization of what pure conscious energy shows...  Math is the subjective realization of the quality of consciousness...  Science is the imagination of desire... and Art is the unitary program for experience...  God is Math, Science is it's force, and Art is qualified egoic creation...  Ego's are expendable just as human bodies are...  God is Eternal... the finite bodies of infinity are just that, not meant to be forever and so, are not the true vehicle of God's permanent indwelling as an individuated being...  As Dr. Ball will find out when his Earth experience is over...  Between Creator and creation there is a oneness... but Creator and creation can never be the same reality even though the phenomena is singular...  ultimately Dr. Ball has given his ego too much credence","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

Yes, and I will update it as I go along.  Mr. Schimmel grew up in the Orthodox Jewish community.  In his early twenties he stopped believing that the Torah was god-given.  He left the community in spirit but apparently still goes to services.  Some might think this intellectually incomprehensible, and so did I upon first reading.  But then I started to think about it.  Here is what I came up with: Suppose you were raised believing that god (should one exist) didn't want you to walk on the cracks of the sidewalk or the ground.  Now you're twenty years old and you start to have doubts and finally conclude this is nonsense.  But still, after admitting such to yourself, you continue to avoid the cracks.  Why?  Well, because it has become ritual.  You need it.  You're used to it.  Perhaps you are comforted by it.  Not many people can give up a belief and go cold turkey on all the accompanying ritual(s).  And that's one of the dangers of religion.  So it is possible to break away from something in the mind, but more difficult to break away from the ritual.  One might say that the person is addicted to rituals at this point.  If he/she gives up the sidewalk ritual it will need to be replaced by something else.  Again it is difficult for many to go cold turkey.  So I can understand why Mr. Schimmel still goes to services.  Perhaps one day he will fully make the break, or even get sucked back in.  In any event, I look foward to the rest of the book.<br /><br />01-04-09<br />I finished the book a couple of days ago and my rating remains the same.  Of course, for me (as an atheist), Mr. Schimmel was preaching to the choir.  There were some parts I thought could have been a little stronger, but overall, I found most every page interesting.  My biggest complaint would be my opinion that Schimmel is naive in thinking his book could help \\""convert\\"" someone who believes in his/her religion into someone who does not.  Anyone who does change his/her mind was probably already on the road to disbelief and this book was just another stepping-stone.  The true believers will only use the defense mechanisms that are explained in the book to continue believing in his/her religion.<br /><br />Now if, for example, you are an Orthodox Jew and read this book, chances are excellent that you won't agree with the parts where the author discredits the notion that Moses received any prophecy from God.  But I would ask you this-- Did you find his evidence against the other religions (namely Christianity and Islam) compelling?  If yes, you must ask yourself how come you can see why their religion is false and yours is true.  If you say that you can't judge the information about whether or not their religions are true or false because you don't know enough about them, then you must ask yourself how you can believe so strongly in your religion when you haven't satisfactorily studied the other major religions (and for that matter, some not so major religions) to determine just which one is true (if any).<br /><br />That's all.d was probably already on the road to disbelief and this book was just another stepping-stone.

Betrayal is well written, flows together well, and keeps one reading to the very end. Ms Grant has a firm grasp of the Regency period, and knows both how to work with and around the morés of the time.     Betrayal was a bit of a darker read than I expected. There is a good deal of non-marital sex throughout the story (although the hero's mistress is one of the most sympathetic characters), including a rape scene. But to the author's credit, such scenes are refreshingly non-graphic, except for the rape scene, and then only enough details are included as are necessary to reflect the heroine's helplessness and horror.    Love, of course, wins the day in the end, healing the many hurts of the past.    One curiosity of Betrayal is that it carries the feeling of coming into the middle of another story, even though it is listed as the first book in Ms Grant's series. This raises a number of questions in the mind of the reader about the hero's and heroine's motivations as the story opens, which are only partially answered as the story progresses. However, I understand that the author is publishing a prequel to Betrayal in 2009, which undoubtedly will fill in many of the blanks in Betrayal. I, for one, am looking forward to seeing how it all began!","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

General Auchinleck got credit for the hardwon victory, but lacked the means to immediately follow up.  An impatient Winston Churchill replaced him as Eighth Army CO with LtGen Bernard Montgomery, a man with an unlovely personality, a lucky star, and a plan to win.  The stage was set for a duel in the desert at El Alamein...<br /><br />&#34;El Alamein 1942&#34; is an Osprey Campaign Series book, well-written by Ken Ford, with illustrations by Howard Gerrard.  In under 100 pages, the author does an excellent if compressed job describing the battles of El Alamein, including Auchinleck's victory and the two-part confrontation between Montgomery and Rommel.  A fast-moving narrative walks the reader up through the opposing commanders and their plans and forces, and how tactics and supplies played equally weighty parts in the outcome of battle.  The text clearly describes the multiple phases of an extended fight, supported by an excellent selection of period photographs, illustrations, maps, and battle diagrams.  The book is easily accessible to the general reader and is a useful summary for the student of the conflict.  Recommended.","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

He enjoys a contented life with his wife, Mary Ann, and his 20-year-old developmentally disabled son, Todd. Although George worries a little over Todd's future, the young man's sunny disposition and affinity with animals make him a joy to be around. He is challenged, however, when Todd hears a radio announcement from the local animal shelter, asking locals to take home a dog just for the holidays.    Todd is so enthused that George has a hard time discouraging him, but he tries. George just cannot bring himself to have another relationship with a new dog; he has loved and lost two in his lifetime, and can't bear to put himself through that trauma again. George also wants to instill character in his son, believing it's good for Todd to know that he can't have everything and anything his heart desires. However, when Todd speaks to his mom, Mary Ann agrees that hosting a dog for just a week shouldn't be a problem. (George quips: \\""Our home is not a democracy. It is a benevolent dictatorship. Queen Mary Ann had spoken.\\"")    As might be expected, Todd and Mary Ann finally persuade George, although George frequently reminds Todd that any dog they take will be returned to the animal  shelter on December 26th. At the shelter, he is touched to see the care Todd takes in checking out each dog. The worker there also appears to be impressed with Todd's interest and sincerity. Todd finally settles on a big black lab retriever mix, an older and extremely well-behaved stray he calls \\""Christmas.\\""    Christmas settles in with the McCray family with ease. Todd and Christmas, of course, are constantly together. George puts little stock in his son's excited report that they found giant cat tracks near their creek. He joins the locals in scoffing at any suggestions that there might be cougars in the woods. At the most, he expects that any sightings have actually been of bobcats, and when he can't find the paw prints, he dismisses them entirely.    Meanwhile, as Todd and Mary Ann enjoy Christmas's company wholeheartedly, George wrestles with difficult memories. He had befriended a dog he named \\""Good Charlie\\"" on his tour of Vietnam. Now he experiences flashbacks to the consequences of that relationship and is reminded of his war injury. These memories are not totally painful, however, as he also recalls how Mary Ann steadfastly wrote to him and waited for him while he was away.    George continues to remind Todd that Christmas will return to the animal shelter on December 26th even as the family decks the halls in preparation for their big holiday gathering of friends and family. At the party, George bristles a bit at his visitors' good-natured teasing about his canine guest. Partly in spite, he comes up with an idea that, once set in motion, reverberates throughout the community, transforming into a believable and wonderful holiday miracle.    A DOG NAMED CHRISTMAS is a quick and uplifting read that makes for a perfect respite from the bustle and stress of the season. Dog lovers particularly will enjoy wrapping up in this cozy cuddle of a story, which is sure to keep them warm on the coldest winter night.    --- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon (terryms2001@yahoo.com)","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

He travelled to Eritrea to work as an English teacher and while the book mentions the capital of the State of Eritrea, he also spent some time travelling in Eritrea, working in the beautiful mountain top town of Keren, as well as Massawa on the Red Sea coast.<br /><br />He describes his encounters with everyday people in Eritrea and the places he visits elaborately and the reader can picture these places he visits quite vividly, plus the people with whom he relates with. He writes with a very observant eye and this detail manifests itself throughout the book, making the story all that more interesting, from the first page to the last page. He describes people, places cafes, rooms and the surrounding countryside so vividly. This I feel captivates the reader and for anyone who has travelled to Eritrea and experienced its contrasts between urban Asmara and the countryside within, it is a great read.<br /><br />I particularly liked this book,as I spent 6 years living and working in Eritrea and was able to experience the country and its people in the aftermath of the Border war. The serene beauty of the mountain town of Keren and the heavy stifling heat of Massawa, contrast with the capital, Asmara and its fascinating array of period buidlings and architecture. Justin's account of his time in Eritrea probably best describe why people who visit this timeless land tend to fall in love with the country and its people. The beauty of its countryside and the difference between urban living in the main towns and the countryside. It tends to cast a spell over the visitor.<br /><br />Like my experiences, Justin's eventual departure from Eritrea as the Border war erupted was coated with reluctance and tinged with sadness. His frantic departure was a high point to the book as it comes to a close. I was captivated by his time and shared his sadness at the need to depart and say goodbye to the many people he had forged strong friendships with. Like Justin, I had journeyed to Eritrea for a reason; he came to teach and I came to assist with the landmine and unexploded ordnance problem.<br /><br />In summary a well written book, rich in descriptions of places and people.

It's charming the way Tarte accepts his wife's desire to get \\""just one bunny,\\"" it's endearing the way he rebounds from the arrival of each additional animal to their lives, and it's downright miraculous he retains his sense of humor even after he forfeits his identity and becomes little more than a slave to his charges, a gaggle of animals including ducks, geese, parrots, turkeys and cats. Tarte's humor is dry, wry and constantly catching his reader by surprise. And as the slave to nearly a hundred animals of my own, I finally felt a twinge of sympathy for my similarly besieged husband, David. I can only pray the two never get together and discuss vet bills . . .    \\""Enslaved by Ducks\\"" reaffirms that each creature great and small has their own identity, heart and soul, and like Bob Tarte, a hard-core sense of humor, as well!  --Kathleen M.

It is the sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Ernest Hemingway (and many others) called it the greatest American novel ever. Huck Finn picks up right where Tom Sawyer left off - Huck's abusive father appears to lay claim to Huck's fortune, so Huck fakes his own death and goes down the Mississippi River with Jim, the escaped slave.<br /><br />Much like Tom Sawyer, there's not a lot of plot going on here most of the time, and that's okay, because Twain's writing is extremely entertaining. Twain has a good old time mocking social conventions, and the novel is gripping almost all the way through. Hemingway was right: the end of Huck Finn is poor. After Jim is abducted and Tom Sawyer reappears, things just get silly, not to mention highly convenient (And Tom Sawyer here is just as immature as he ever was, reinforcing that no real maturation occurred in Tom Sawyer, and that that book really isn't a coming-of-age story in the truest sense).<br /><br />Twain has made Huck the narrator. On the whole, this works, although it gets tiresome to read Huck's dialect sometimes. Twain-as-narrator is definitely missed here. Nobody could write a clever sentence like Twain, and most of that is lost here, although occasionally Huck will turn one (and by doing so break character, but that's the price you pay).<br /><br />Huck Finn has been exceedingly controversial because of the extensive use of the n-word. So is the novel racist? Certainly the characters have the racism of the day ingrained in them - in that sense, it is racist. But more important to most people is whether Twain was racist; that is, whether he put his own personal racism in the book. That is harder to determine, especially since Twain has made Huck the narrator. Perhaps the fairest thing to say is that Twain was genuinely criticizing racism, but the way in which he portrayed Jim and the other characters contains some residual racism of its own.<br /><br />So is Huck Finn America's greatest novel? Well, maybe not. But it's definitely up there.ism of its own.<br /><br />So is Huck Finn America's greatest novel? Well, maybe not. But it's definitely up there.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

Spanning a wide range of topics to do with libraries, the work is separated into three parts: The Library through Time; The Library in Imagination; and The Library Now and in the Future. Being both a librarian by profession and a cultural historian of sorts (by dint of having studied the Cultural History of Western Europe for three years at undergraduate level), I chose to home in on The Library in Imagination, and I was definitely not disappointed. The wide grasp of the subject, and the depth of the insights, was astounding. From Marina Warner’s acknowledgement of the seminal value of the Epic of Gilgamesh, through Robert Crawford’s exploration of the librarian as ennobled and immortalized in poetry (and I can think of a number of librarians who would love to be so remembered), to Laura Marcus’s pursuit of the image of the haunted library and the library as labyrinth (with special focus, much to my delight, being paid to the library as presented in all its convolutions and Mediaeval ramifications in The Name of the Rose), the authors never fail to intrigue and enlighten. Not only are the contributors all experts in their field, but they are also such excellent writers that one can truly savor each word and sentence that they write. Their rhapsodical descriptions embody the mystery that lies at the core of the library as phenomenon stretching down the ages. For instance, Warner draws attention to the “way of making [which] is important with regard to the library in fiction, viewed not only as a particular place where single titles or book-objects have been collected, but as a metaphor for literature itself, a polyphony of voices, laid down on multiple tracks, looping and converging over time, sometimes over great vistas of time”.  In short, the richness and wealth of information that is embodied in library collections is brought only honor and memorableness in this text.<br /><br />Whoever thought of a library as being a prosaic and stuffy old place that bears little relevance to the current digital age must definitely think again. Rounding off the work with an acknowledgement of the significance of libraries even in the modern day and age, given by Library of Congress James H. Billington, tribute is paid to the role of the library as a purveyor of knowledge that is geared towards satisfying mankind’s ongoing search for the truth. The Meaning of the Library: A Cultural History is a riveting and deeply satisfying work that is bound to leave the reader not only far more aware of the sociocultural importance of the institution as a reservoir of heritage and learning, but also inspired to think of issues that lie beyond the earthly and temporal realm.over great vistas of time”.

Dr. Taylor describes the occurrence of her stroke and the immediate days and weeks that followed, written with the clarity and precision of a trained neuroanatomist.  Dr. Taylor suffered (temporary) loss of the functions of the dominant logical left brain, and discovered the capabilities of the (normally) subordinate right brain.  Later chapters describe some of her long-term learnings regarding trusting and relying on the capabilities of her right-brain.  The reader has to trust what she writes, something of a \\""leap of faith\\"", but that really is to be expected when using the logical left-brain's tool of language to describe the contextual perceptual processing of the right brain.   The book is easy to pick up and start reading at any spot, and hard to put down.  Highly recommended.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

Lawrence","5","0","0","N","Y","D H Lawrence in Taos","An interesting and well-written book: two Danish painters, Knud Merrild and Kai Gotzsche, traveling on what little means they had in America, met up with DH Lawrence and Frieda, who asked the two men to join them, help them repair their ramshackle ranch and cabins, and live with them up there above 8,000 feet, remote from Taos and others, the three months of winter. Lawrence always wanted a little community of good people together and this group of four is as close as he got to that. Merrild describes their interactions, personalities,  the adventures and scenes of daily rural life living on the ranch. He writes about Lawrence as he knew him, and quotes his words frequently, who as he says, is best able to speak his words himself as he has written them. In 1923 Lawrence and Frieda were in New York and going back to Europe, when she ended up going alone, and Lawrence surprised the two artists when he went to Los Angeles to join them, who had traveled west and found work there. Lawrence never was anywhere for long, and was always seeking the next place to go (sometimes to write the next novel), and alone without Frieda, not liking the city of Los Angeles (or any city in general) wanted to go back to Mexico to see if he could find a house or a farm to settle. Usually traveling with Frieda, Lawrence seems to have rarely traveled alone, and Gotzsche went with Lawrence to Mexico. There is an interesting firsthand account of this trip I have not seen elsewhere, mostly from letters they each wrote Merrild who was in Los Angeles.","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

Which \\""ist\\"" are you?  Knowing which \\""ist\\"" you are is vital to your spiritual health, your spiritual growth, and how you see the gap that exists between Christ and the culture.  For brevity's sake let me put it this way:  a Separatist separates; a Conformist conforms; and a Transformist transforms.  \\""Oh real genius Bill!  Even I could see that by looking!\\""  Oh really?  Do you know what makes a person of the three \\""ists\\""?  Do you know what makes them different as to how they deal with culture?  Read the book and you will.  Kary spends time on each \\""ist\\"" with the Separatist and Conformist getting his first attention (in separate detail).  His greater portion is spent with the Transformist, which shows you which one Christ-followers ought to find themselves in.  The book has perfectly placed diagrams that illustrate his points along the way. I learned something on almost every page but the coup de grace was Part IV-chapters 11-14.  It was in those chapters that he \\""fleshed out\\"" with real examples all he had been talking about in the previous 3 chapters on being a Transformist.  The examples are real, sometimes heart-tugging but so appropriate in showing the way a Christ-follower should walk that \\""fine line.\\""  He also did a marvelous job in comparing the Kingdom of Earth vs. the Kingdom of Heaven and Modernism vs. Post-Modernism.  I am convinced that even the most \\""studious\\"" and knowledgeable person of either of the above topics would benefit from his comparison charts.  Hands down possibly the best \\""wrap up\\"" I have seen on them.<br /><br />If for no other reason I would buy The Fine Line for the \\""wrap up.\\"" But along the way you will also learn what causes rifts in the body of Christ and why it is so important to know which \\""ist\\"" you belong to.

How smart am I?!?!<br />In all seriousness, this is a unique book that includes 50 fab fabulous projects for fathers to make with their children. Projects include everything from samurai swords to pocket-size dolls, wizard wands to paper zoos.<br />First and foremost! All projects can be made from affordable, easy-to-find items—often regular household ones already owned. I don’t know about you; but once I’m all excited about a project I want to do the project NOW!! I don’t want to run to the store, I don’t want to order it on-line, because if that happens ….. wellllllll the project usually sits around for days or weeks!!  My absolute favorite part of this book is the first section labeled  “Before You Start”, you will know what items you need to have on hand!!  A good list of things to have on hand are already in my craft cupboard; things like a hot glue gun, double-sided tape, and so on.<br />There are 253 pages in Made With Dad.  The projects are great for kids as young as 6 and older. Packed with 50 different projects from model making to cooking, crafting to experimenting.<br />Other sections include: Easy Projects, Arts and Crafts, Waves and Wheels, Great Adventures, Final Frontiers, Happy Holidays, and Advanced Models. Each section has projects for the younger kids too and ones that both boys and girls would be interested in.<br />One of the best features of this book is the short “Being There” page providing suggestions on how to build a strong father/child bond. I love that!!<br />Added bonus, you can access all the templates from the book on the Made With Dad website which is awesome if you don’t want to cut up your book or if you bought the digital download.<br />This is a wonderful book to help you connect with their children which is so important!!<br />Disclosure: I have received a free or greatly discounted product for the purpose of this review. The opinions are 100% mine.u don’t want to cut up your book or if you bought the digital download.<br />This is a wonderful book to help you connect with their children which is so important!!<br />Disclosure: I have received a free or greatly discounted product for the purpose of this review.

In her second book “How to Live a Guided Life FIRST STEPS” Linda continues to share with us insights from her spirit guide angels that she receives from them to this day.<br /><br />In the foreword section of “How to Live a Guided Life FIRST STEPS” Linda explains what it means to live a guided life and how it benefits you.  In the following chapters Linda shares each insight and explains how it works in her life and in yours.  You learn that it is important to first understand who you are.  Your self imposed limitations and stress affect your self-esteem and decision making process, and as a result you second-guess yourself and may feel regret over decisions you have made.  Linda’s spirit guide angels assist you in slowing down and seeing situations more clearly so you can make the best decisions for your life.<br /><br />In the course of the book Linda talks about struggle, fear, worry, acceptance, enlightenment, and abundance.  Every insight channeled from her spirit guide angels is designed to help you make decisions in your life with confidence and without fear, as well as how to believe in yourself and how to trust your intuition.  It is their wish that Linda share these awarenesses with us to help us eliminate the conflict in our own lives so that we can shine.  They have no personal agenda other than to help us live a fulfilling life even among the inevitable challenges that present themselves along our journey.<br /><br />This concise book was easy to read and understand.  Linda provides clarity to the messages received from her spirit guide angels so that we can feel more powerful,see situations as they really are, and be assured that the decisions we make are the right ones for our lives.  This book also helps us understand that when we earnestly tune in to them we can connect with our own spirit guide angels.  We are never alone but always in the presence of those who know us best.  We can invite their guidance into our lives to help us in our decision making process so that we can ultimately be true to ourselves.","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

This is the only book from this author that I did not have that ravenous hunger to read.  I usually cannot put down one of Mr. Patterson's books, but this one was hard to pick up.  Not only did he spend way too much time with Alex Cross abroad, the situations were ridiculous, even for a \\""fictional\\"" character.  If Mr. Patterson's intention was to use his book as a platform for the injustices being imposed on the people of Africa, he did so at the risk of losing a market share of fans who turn to him for a good read on an already well-developed cast of characters.  The Alex Cross in this novel is nothing like the character in all the others.  When I reached the end of the novel, I said to myself \\""that's it?\\""  It was just disappointing.

It also helps that Mr. Miller is very masterful in the art of story telling, expertly weaving back in forth through the past and present without confusing the readers or disturbing the flow of the story.<br /><br />Readers of the first installment will be pleased to see that Mr. Miller has not lost a step with the follow up.

I had met the author and heard great things about it, so I was excited to read it. It was really cute and great, exactly what I thought it would be. This book is about Cece, she loses her hearing when she is four and has to wear hearing aids from then on. This book shows what it is like to be deaf and to use hearing aids, that is not what it is all about. A major part of this book is her quest for a true friend. I really liked this book and it taught me a lot about what it is like to use a hearing aid, I had never truly understood before. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good friendship story or what it is like to be deaf. I would also say that this book is intended for middle or elementary schoolers, not high school (although that does not mean that they can not read it (look at me)). I give this book four stars because it was really cute and had a great message.<br /><br />Maci's Review: El Deafo by Cece Bell is sweet and to the point. It is about a girl named Cece who looses her hearing when she is little and how she copes with it. She gets hearing aides and learns to lip read so that she can better understand what is going on around her. For her first year of school she is in a class where everyone is like her and uses hearing aides. But her family moves to a new town and she starts at a new school. At this new school she has to figure out how to make friends, but first how to accept herself. She has to accept herself before she can be accepted by others. This graphic novel shows a neat perspective on what it is like to be deaf. It also shows how you need to accept yourself to be happy and make friends. I would recommend this book to anyone who liked Smile by Raina Telgemeier or a story about acceptance.","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

She is not out to do a hatchet job of debunking the Long March per se or the idealism of the marchers.  That China would even let her in to talk to these people, and speak so candidly about the buttside of the PRC's founding mythos, perhaps reflects how little meaning the Long March now has for China's current rulers.<br /><br />That the Long March contained examples of tragedy with its triumph, wanton callousness striding beside the highest ideals, should not come as any great revelation to those who study human history.  There are no survivors of other long marches to interview - like the Israelites Moses led through the wilderness from Egypt - but if  there had been a contemporary historian looking up surviving marchers he would have doubtless found such recriminating memories there as well, calling into question the myth and romance of the whole thing, the quality of the \\""Promised Land\\"" as delivered, and Moses' alleged divinity of inspiration.  There is always a \\""man behind the curtain\\"" when one comes before the Great Oz, so our anti-Communist debunkers really have little to gloat about here.<br /><br />A more fascinating project, I think, would have been to focus on what the Long Marchers make of China as it evolved afterward.  Did they still identify with the movement after the Great Leap forward and the Cultural Revolution, seeing these as fulfillment or betrayal of their hopes?  And what would they make of the era of Chairman Sam, as Wal-Mart merges Mao with Mammon?  In such opinions might come hope for the Chinese people today, as they flounder in a mindless dead-end disguised as \\""reform\\"" and \\""development.\\""<br /><br />This book covers old terrain but does a good job taking the reader down overgrown side trails and unearthing those little mounds beyond the historical markers.  Perhaps its greatest service is to portray an allegory of life itself: we can't know our final destination in our own Long March, and the best we can do is hope and hold on along the way.nd the best we can do is hope and hold on along the way.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

Martin Dies; whose name the establishment loves to vilify, provides excellent insight into the history and danger of communist infiltration into the U.S.. In speaking of the depression, he states the only reason we came out of high unemployment was because of defense and war production. This was not the result of FDR's welfare programs. Research the true story of how Pearl Harbor really happened, and you will find this to be true. In speaking of that event, Dies describes a 285 page report that was written on Japanese intelligence activities involving Pearl Harbor. Dies relays the information to Secretary of State Cordell Hull who then tells him not to make the information public. This is just more proof to add to the lie that was PearI Harbor. I found it absolutely fascinating when Dies describes a situation in which he was being set up by a woman in order to provide a salacious photo opportunity for the press in order to discredit him. She pretended to be offering information about communist activity in the country. This reminds me of the circumstance that Jim Garrison found himself in when trying to investigate the JFK assassination.<br />Martin Dies provides some excellent insight into the problems of the U.S.. He describes the decline of moral character of the people running for office. Paraphrasing his analogy; he states, can you imagine Washington, Jefferson, or a Lincoln prostrating himself in order to secure votes? &#34;Would a statesman hire a burlesque show to attract and entertain his audience?&#34; Watch a Republican or Democratic convention, and isn't that exactly what is taking place. But then that also says a lot about us as a people and how &#34;dumbed down&#34; we have become.<br />Martin Dies also most profoundly states, &#34;In America we have too many people who do not believe in anything. They are devoid of real convictions, for them there is no guiding, inspiring, and activating life. In a contest with communists, such people cannot hope to survive. Communists gladly risk their lives...millions in America will not risk anything in support of Americanism. There are few people in public office today who will risk their jobs for principles.&#34;<br />To close with that theme, let us not forget the admonition of Jesus Christ:<br /><br />For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.

To the east of Pangea was a vast sea known as Tethys. When the forces of plate tectonics broke Pangea up into massive component land masses, Tethys formed a great equatorial sea between the northern Laurasia and the southern Gondwanaland, expanding east-west ocean circulation that saw the birth of modern marine life. By five million years ago, Tethys was no more; all that remains of her today is the Mediterranean Sea. In Vanished Ocean: How Tethys Reshaped the World, author Dorrik Stow – a renowned geologist and oceanographer who specializes in deep ocean research – not only traces the long lifecycle of Tethys but utilizes this structure as a framework to probe plate tectonics, evolution, extinction events, oceanic conveyor belts, geology, climate change, of origin of fossil fuels, and much, much more!<br /> Vanished Ocean is a brilliant work and clearly a labor of love for Stow, whose elegant writing style turns complex scientific concepts into an immensely readable narrative that is comprehensible for the most part to the general reader with at least some familiarity with earth science principles. This is enhanced by a number of tables, illustrations and maps, as well as an ample “glossary of terms,” neatly accented by appropriate snippets of Pablo Neruda verse at the face of each chapter. It is clear from his passion that for Stow the processes of the earth and the evolution of both the organic and inorganic that it hosts represent a kind of poetry in motion, and his enthusiasm is eminently contagious for the reader, even in the occasional moments when the concepts are so complex that a paragraph may need to be re-read more than once.  Still, if you know something about plate tectonics and evolution, there is nothing here that is not accessible. It is a real treat to listen to Stow relate the story – along with anecdotes of his life and travels that clearly reveal that even after a lifetime of research he remains as delightfully full of wonder as an eight year old child as the processes of the planet – much of these echoes of a far distant era -- are exposed.<br /> There is controversy here, as well. Stow does not buy into the accepted catastrophic theory of dinosaur extinction, which a scientific consensus today attributes to a massive asteroid collision 65 million years ago at the Chicxulub Crater beneath Mexico’s Yucat&aacute;n Peninsula in what is geologically referred to as the “KT Boundary Event” that marks the end of both the Cretaceous Period and the Mesozoic Era. Stow argues with great conviction that given the frequency of mass extinction events over the long geologic history of the earth, there are plenty of ingredients in place – such as climate change and the continental drift of plate tectonics – to account for such an extinction without introducing an extra-planetary event. I lack the expertise to parse Stow’s dissent. On the other hand, Stow is a distinguished scientist – not some talking head with a political axe to grind – and his opposing views are worthy of respect even if these defy the current accepted theory.<br /> I will not pretend to have absorbed all of the complicated concepts of Vanished Ocean, but it was a most enjoyable read and I may one day even read it again in order to better comprehend the immense range of the material that Stow has packed into what is after all, a rather small volume given the enormity of its content. I would highly recommend this book both to scientists and non-scientists alike.ssible.

I see now from reading some other reviews on Amazon that it is probably best to read these novels in order, but I really had very little trouble figuring out the personal issues the characters were dealing with.<br /><br />This is a solid, tightly-plotted book with tons of clues, red-herrings, and all the conventional trappings mystery fans expect of a British detective novel. In many ways, it goes above and beyond the typical mystery novel, in that George takes quite a bit of time to explain the inner workings of her characters. I must say that in the case of Deborah and Simon, I skipped over pages and pages of Deborah's incessant whining about her previous abortion and state of her marriage. It felt like such a conservative-esque cliche: woman has abortion, regrets it, and OOPS, now can't get pregnant and is tormented incessantly by this choice. This sub-plot had absolutely nothing (let me repeat that: nothing) to do with the mystery at hand, and I found it rather tiring to slog through. Perhaps I would have cared more about these people if I had read the earlier novels, but I found the book coming to a screeching halt any time Deborah or Simon was on the page.<br /><br />Lynley himself is a well-drawn character, although he makes one decision about not turning in an admitted pedophile that I found morally repugnant. Apart from that and the moments with Deborah/Simon, this was a really great book that moves along at a quick pace, always giving the reader something to chew on.

The sci-fi element really isn't important though, as it's just a very subtle background for a character-driven story from a point of view that we often ignore: the lambs, cows, and other animals that humans consume and use on a daily basis. A natural question that stems from this novel is why the 'students' don't just run away or rebel against the system? Well, why don't cows (or slaves) just run away? Because they've been domesticated to serve, and that's their entire life. It's saddening and disturbing to think that while the students are seemingly normal (filled with friendship, happiness, and sadness), their entire goal in life is be a good carer and a good donor before 'completing.' Even those characters that seem to have strong will and vent their frustrations (Ruth and Tommy) accept their lives without argument.    Excellent story.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

Oil tankers do not make 40 knots, not even over powered aircraft carriers make anything close to this speed. Also a 500' ship does not maneuver or change speed very quickly, nor can a oil tanker be easily converted to a hygienic ship for soy milk (plus when trading with the US it would have to prove it meets all sorts of FDA regulations). Ospreys are terrible helicopters, extremely expensive to buy and operate, and are only operated by the US Military. It would be easy (and much cheaper) to operate an armed helicopter from a boat. I can also not believe that spy satellites would not have recognized when a bay suddenly became over 500 feet shorter.  These are only a few of the technical problems with the book.    In addition to this, David Stone seems have strong dislikes, and to see things as all black and white. I have been to Singapore, and I would not describe it as negatively as David Stone. Compared to many places in the world, it is very pleasant, and people in the country are generally quite happy.    It was entertaining enough, but low in quality, which seems to be common in this genre, and is why I normally avoid it. I much prefer an author that strives to make the scenario realistic since, among other things, you can learn something from the novel. Unfortunately, many people do not recognize that a novel is fantasy, and this one obviously is.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

Why? I am married to a Peruvian and although at the time I had only visited Peru once I was quite taken with the country and the people and I felt drawn there. Streets Of Lima was a fun and interesting destination for me where I could at least see someone living where and as I wished I could. My wife doesn’t wish to return to live in Peru or else I think it would have already happened. Fast forward a few years and now I find that Rhein has written a memoir of his time spent living in Peru.<br />The book is full of what I would expect would be normal experiences for a person living in not just a foreign country but also a foreign way of life. For Rhein it went beyond the normal way of learning a new culture, a new way of life, as he didn’t try to just live it. He attacked it recklessly, full speed ahead without giving thought to the consequences. With too much thought or planning I think he wouldn’t have actually been in the moment and experiencing life. I don’t know if I could have been as brave as he was given my penchant for sticking to the same old same old. Well, at least I used to be that way.<br />So what is Reckless Traveler about you may ask? If you want stories about embarrassing language gaffes you will find it in this book. If you want stories about being bullheaded about modern medicine and absolutely knowing that traditional ways are useless it’s in this book. If you want stories of devilishly allowing others believe you are a typical gringo who doesn’t even take the time to learn to speak the local language it’s in this book. If you want stories about letting go of the rigid way of thinking life is as you’ve learned and accepting another place based on what it is instead of what it isn’t you will find it in this book. If you want stories of reckless travel to see places and things of incredible beauty you will find it in this book. All told with great humor in a natural way that always left me wanting to read a few pages more, just a few more. That’s the sign of a great book to me.<br />I’m sure Walter Rhein could have told even more stories and this book could have swelled to two or three times its size but as it is it’s pretty perfect. It left me wanting more, just a little more. I even found myself seeking out my wife to read to her from the pages more than once and she enjoyed the stories as well. Perhaps in a few years there will be a sequel, a volume two. After all, the Walter Rhein still travels to Peru and I believe he is there now as I write this, lucky dog that he is. Books like this make life a lot more enjoyable for me and inspire me to make my dreams come true. Now if only I can figure out a way to make that happen. Buy this book, it’s worth the money, it’s worth the time spent reading it. It’s worth that and much more.","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

The book has 16 chapters and in its pages the author try to put together all the great names of exploration who for some reason or another, traveled these cold and stormy waters of the southest tip of America. The author cover mostly every story, from Magellan, Drake and his vanished Elizabeth Island (curiously he placed an island to the east of Diego Ramirez, but the island is not there), Pedro Sarmiento, Thomas Cavendish, John Davis, Spilbergen, Schouten, Le Maire, Garcia de Nodal and the discovery of Diego Ramirez Island, Roggeveen, Lord Anson's voyages, James Cook, Bougainville, and others. Special mention is made to Fitzroy explorations and the later chapters deal with some other unknown stories of some ships that passed by the stormy Horn, including a passage about the huge icebergs seen in those voyages. The book mention the battle of Coronel and the Falklands in 1914 as well. If English is not your native language, I suggest to have a dictionary at hand, since lots of not very known words are used by the author (most of them are marine terms).<br /><br />Cape Horn is proudly Chilean and that is wrongly shown in the cover picture. The book contain maps, but if you can get one with more detail, better off. The southest part of Chile are just beautiful, you have splendid landscapes and desolated locations you don't find anywhere in the world. Certainly, a great place to travel and see for yourself.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

This is the second book in her Wild at Heart series, but I believe you could easily read this book as a standalone novel.<br /><br />This book starts out on a very adventurous note. Matthew Tucker is chasing someone (who turns out to be Shannon Wilde) when he is attacked by a grizzly bear. Shannon and Matthew end up fleeing the bear by jumping into a raging river, which it turns out, does not turn out survivors. Ever. Soon they are tasked with helping each other survive.<br /><br />As they come out of their adventure, they are married by a local pastor due to the fact that they have been together, alone, for so many days. So now the couple has to come together in spite of different life goals and ways they were brought up.<br /><br />The book is full of mystery, romance, and adventure. If you like historical romance novels you will really enjoy these characters and this story.<br /><br />Thank you to Bethany House for a copy of the book in exchange for my honest review.","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

There is still a connecting thread to that ecstasy-flavored dream that was Reanna's Diaries, but this new material goes way beyond the psychic territory covered there. Richard shares with us here a much wider and vastly deeper perspective of what he finds intriguing and beautiful about women. And he does so with what seems to be a burgeoning sense of confidence. More relaxed and perhaps less forced, this new work is also more commanding. And despite the fact that there is an overall feeling of ease and self-assurance here, there are occasional instances of  tension, almost as if his inner-artist is playing some type of spiritual tug-o-war. For example, the deeply sensual portrait study of \\""Jana\\"" stands in stark contrast to the more serene tone of \\""Favorite Flower\\""; and the infectious energy of \\""The Beach Dancer\\"" alights in comparison to the more traditional figure studies presented throughout. But it's the gorgeous masterpieces, sequined throughout the book, that bring everything together and construct the sensory Étouffée that make this such a compelling body of work. A personal favorite is \\""Requim\\"". This photograph is a virtual symphony of texture, color, and form. The interplay between the subject's reclining shape and the sheer, star-covered shroud that she's draped across her naked body is absolutely dazzling. And the compositional magnificence of the larger-than-life \\""L'aube Nue\\"" make this book a worthy collector's item all by itself. This image could grace the wall of any museum.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

According to mr. Weiner, the people of Rotterdam, the Netherlands derive their happiness from riding bikes, prostitution and soft drugs. Not elaborating on the first, he skips researching the prostitution argument (failing to mention that Rotterdam has no red light district, only the kind of shady places you'll find anywhere in the world) and after having a stab at a nearby weed joint (which is not legal but tolerated) decides this is not the lifestyle for him and happily checks the been-there-done-that box. In the process, a local professor who studies happiness is written off as a mathematician. In fear of having to sit through a session in which the Swiss, which are up next, getting their high from eating chocolate and hearing cuckoo clocks every hour, I just tossed it in the charity box, which is the only way this book gave me bliss.

In fact, this book is so similar in style and structure to Collins' \\""The Moonstone\\"" it's as if Stoker was channeling Collins, whose novels he was known to have admired.  With Jewel, Stoker no doubt hoped to cash in on the immense popularity and obsession with all things Egyptian, still raging years after Napoleon's notorious expedition there.       I really like the narrator in this story.  One of the most appealing aspects of that genre to me is the tendency to tell it in the first-person narrative, a trend that has returned to the book world with a vengeance in recent years, I've noticed.  I do love it when it's done right, and for some reason I especially favor the male point of view when reading from a first-person perspective.        Young barrister Malcolm Ross is summoned in the middle of the night by Margaret Trelawney, a woman he'd only recently met at a party but had become immediately intrigued by.  When Malcolm arrives at the Trelawney estate he finds that Margaret's father has been stricken by a mysterious coma-like illness and lies in his rooms among the treasure trove of Egyptian artifacts he has collected over the years.  He has left very stern but mystifying instructions about what may have happened to him and what Margaret needs to do (and more importantly, what she must NOT do) until, and if, he awakens.  Margaret is in despair with worry and has no one she feels she can turn to except Malcolm.  When another attack and then a theft takes place the next evening, the doctor and police detective who have also by necessity been called in are inclined to think Margaret herself is the culprit, which Malcolm feels in his heart cannot be true.      Another man soon appears and tells a long, fantastic story about he and Mr. Trelawney in their younger days, which they spent traveling in Egypt and combing tombs, especially that of Queen Tera of the Theban dynasty.  This remarkable queen had been a visionary of her day and a powerful sorceress as well, and her knowledge was so feared that upon her death her name was erased from Egyptian history and her tomb in the Valley of the Sorcerers hidden away (this is all fictional as far as I know).  But Queen Tera had the magic to allow her to live beyond the grave, and a crucial element of that magic was a great ruby jewel that contained seven stars within, correlating precisely to the constellation under which she was born ¡V the jewel that Mr. Trelawney now has, along with at least part of the knowledge key to unlocking its magic.      Needless to say, Miss T reeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaally doesn't appreciate the tomb raiders' sticky fingers all up in her magic bling.     Trelawney isn't out to rob the great queen, though.  Actually, he wants to help her by deciphering the messages and items she left behind to achieve what she wanted most - immortality.      While there's a good bit of Egyptian lore and mysticism here, there's also a very healthy dose of philosophy, science, and religion in the discourses between the characters, and I can only imagine how sensational those exchanges must have been to a reading public in that particular era.  Stoker's knowledge of all manner of things mystical and quasi-scientific is pretty impressive, I must say.    Of course I won't give away the ending, but one of the most interesting trivia bits about this book is that when it was first released in 1903, it was at the reluctance of the publishers because the ending was thought to be too depressing and the chapter on religion a little too controversial for the general reader.  They agreed to publish it onlybecause Stoker was fairly well-known by then for Dracula.  However, upon seeking re-release of it a few years later, Stoker was told he had to change the ending, as well as remove the one offending chapter completely, or it was a no-go.  He agreed, and that watered-down version was the only one available for almost 100 years.  I read the original version first, then the revamped ending via the Gutenberg Project online.  Both endings are disappointing, frankly!  The original ends bleakly and in a hurried, unexplained fashion, and the revamp, while doing a bit more in the 'finishing out', left me thinking \\""well, what was the point?\\""      Still a fun read, though, and I liked it.  Not on par with Dracula by a long shot, but enjoyable.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

A much heralded classic of modern literature that lives up to its promise and hype. The plot is outlined in multiple reviews, so, as usual, I will skip that, and focus on what was done right (a lot), what was done wrong (a little), and what it all means.<br /><br />The book was a well-written character study on the part of almost all of the characters. This is one of the widely regarded aspects of the book that holds water. Nurse Ratched, (Nurse Wretched, perhaps?) the totalitarian commander of the insane asylum where R.P. McMurphy finds himself, has widely been portrayed as a figure of evil, or at least one of obedience to the law because it IS the law. Never in the work, suspiciously, are we given the opportunity to question whether Ms. Ratched truly doesn't have the patient's interests at heart. Instead, we are treated to innuendo about her obsessive need for control and order, perhaps leading some to question the sanity of Ms. Ratched. Regardless of the truth, it is a welcome question, offering a depth of thought not common in heralded classics, in my view.<br /><br />McMurphy, naturally, was the most interesting character in the book, by turn pensive or outrageous, obedient or mischievous. Our much beloved anti-hero, who can stand up to the grinding forces of the corrupt mental health institution and remain himself. But is he? At several points, \\""Chief\\"" Bromden, our unreliable narrator, points to the haunted and hunted look in the eyes of our protagonist, wondering if, perhaps, he is tiring of the fight.<br /><br />Perhaps. Or perhaps our illustrious mischief-maker, our perpetual Loki, has not the heart for making mischief. Perhaps our dear Mr. McMurphy actually wishes merely to conform. At several points, the statements of the anarchist seem to suggest that he feels himself something of a figure of destiny, like Achilles in the movie version of Troy. Perhaps, just perhaps, his fate is NOT his own to make, nor that of the grinding Combine. Perhaps it is rather in the hands of his fellow inmates. McMurphy gives himself freely in a futile chase to remind them that they are men. In return, they take from him everything that he has. Not to speculate too wildly, but perhaps there is something a bit messianic about the book, where an uncontrolled man comes into the midst of the community, bucks the authority, teaches the people that they are human beings with dignity, and ends up giving everything for the people he has adopted.<br /><br />At the end, one must wonder what would have become of Our Protagonist if, perhaps, he had found himself in a more supportive clime, perhaps under the control of the nurse from Disturbed. Or perhaps even better, if he had found himself in a formless place without outside influence to worsen him. He might have become anything, and he might not have burned himself up, approximating the candle that they needed him to become, leading the way through the darkness, back to humanity, back to manhood, back to grace?<br /><br />The other characters are all interesting as well, including Harding, whose alluded to homosexuality, Billy Bibbit's social avoidance disorder due to his mother's reverse Oedipal complex, and Sefelt and Fredrickson's epilepsy has led to their voluntary commission to the ward. These characters, more than anything discussed in their treatment, tell a sad and compelling tale of the state of mental disease in the 1960's. These people don't need ECT or a lobotomy. They need help, and they certainly don't get it here.<br /><br />There was very little done wrong in this book. Perhaps the most grievous thing was the treatment of \\""Chief\\"" Bromden's paranoid schizophrenia. At many times in the novel, it became necessary for me to simply go, \\""All right. We get that Bromden is an unreliable narrator, and that he is hallucinatory. The hallucinations, as a matter of fact, do little but detract from the remainder of the novel. It is fine for the character to be unreliable. Heis in a mental institution, so we probably ought not take everything he says or thinks at face value. Nevertheless, the utter lack of realistic symptomology for this character detracts from his otherwise compelling impact.<br /><br />This was a truly good book, and I will return to it again and again. The search for meaning and for leadership here, for a sense of self in the face of overwhelming pressure to conform, and R. P. McMurphy's final act of heroic surrender, all make this a book worth reading for anyone who is interested in what makes us who we are.<br /><br />B+<br /><br />Harkiust not take everything he says or thinks at face value.

This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of this review.<br /><br />As Black as Ebony by Salla Simukka is the explosive conclusion to the Lumikki Andersson (Snow White Trilogy) series. Lumikki is back at school and moving on with her life. She has a new guy, and instead of sitting on the sidelines she's living. But then her ex drops back into her life and if that wasn't bad enough, she's gained a stalker.<br /><br />So this book was just okay. Lumikki is back in school, she has a lukewarm relationship with a guy she says she loves, and a whole heap of questions for her parents. Lenka opened Lumikki's eyes. She had a sister but where is she and why do her parents not speak of her? She's a woman obsessed with finding the truth.<br /><br />The plot of this relatively short book revolves around Lumikki's past. The stalker is not only obsessed with Lumikki but opening her eyes to her &#34;true self&#34; by revealing truths that were hidden. I found this aspect interesting! And as more and more is revealed the author kept me guessing. I thought I had who the stalker was figured out but I was wrong on all counts and never would've been able to guess it!<br /><br />Overall this book was a nice conclusion to the series. Lumikki (and the readers) get answers about things that have haunted her throughout the series AND it's a great suspenseful read. Personally though I could have done without the romance aspect. There was a love triangle of sorts and it just didn't work for Lumikki because that's not who I picture her being. However if you enjoy crime/thriller novels I suggest you read this one!","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

The realities that he creates in his individual work are grounded in familiar landmarks, but everything else is just outside of the lines; unbelievably believable.  It's a unique voice, and like a high-end alcohol, you don't necessarily want to dilute it.  So, as a primer, I suggest you read 15 MINUTES TO LIVE, or it's earlier phantom, ALWAYS SIX O'CLOCK.<br /><br />In CRUSH, we can clearly see that Phoef can tell an intricate story with multiple sub-plots and make it not only clear, which is delightful, but with a pace that's roller-coaster-esque, which is gratifying.  Further, he does not skimp on character development; each character introduced throughout this thrill ride is clear and complete, with enough back story to be appealing and empathy-inducing....and at the same time keeping enough secrets to keep us reading.<br /><br />Thereare no clichés here:  The heroes are deeply flawed individuals working for their own redemption, and the villains are thoughtful bloodthirsty monsters.  And in the best example of playing against type, Phoef provides some 'laugh out loud' moments betwixt the car-chase-slightly-Spillane-like-sex-and-violence.  Cases in point:  The Russian henchmen who actually question their positions in the hierarchy, and a magician who has the ultimate final trick.  There are no cardboard cutout characters here, folks.<br /><br />And the best part?  There is still so much more to learn about the characters.  The anticipation of what's next moves me to implore the author to not leave me hanging for too much longer for the second installment.<br /><br />I will keep reading as long as Phoef Sutton keeps writing.","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

I immediately want to read this book again. Although I am a Sierra naturalist, Yosemite Interpretive Ranger, educator, and bear lover and protector, this book is for everyone. It reveals many fascinating facts illuminating a long and sordid history from “Male bears even have a muscle that pulls their penis up against their body when they are climbing…” to “At Glacier, women rangers were switched to office duty while menstruating.”<br /><br />Speaking of Bears contextualizes historic perspectives through oral history and detailed research. I was astonished to learn that as early as the 1930’s scientists were investigating human bear interactions and determining some of the same solutions that society and management took much longer to accept, “With the exception of a few park employees...who understood the problem...the advice was ignored and seemingly forgotten.” As stewards of this planet and these parks we can glean from the lessons learned that are revealed in this book.<br /><br />This book invites the world in on a story that many of us have been telling one campfire program at a time. From the many first person accounts and stories to the current science and successful management strategies, this book delights, intrigues, dismays, incites discussion, and above all provides a voice for bears and their protectors.

These short books are a reprint of Ms. Cobles' first two novels, Where Leads the Heart and Plains of Promise. I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this series but alas I have reached the end. The final book in the series, A Heart's Home, is the sixth and final book in the series.<br /><br />In this book, we continue to follow the story of Emmie Croftner and Lieutenant Isaac Liddle at Fort Phil Kearny in the Wyoming Territory. When things look bleak for the two, things tend to get even worse.<br /><br />This book touched my heart more than any of the other's. I was saddened at one point and happy during another. I love it when a story can stir up my emotions.<br /><br />One thing I have always enjoyed about Ms. Coble's writing is her believable character's. In this series, there was actually one character I would have loved to see a little more of and that person showed up in the fifth book, A Heart's Promise. Her name was Maggie O'Donnell, a laundress, who was no more than 16 years old and had been raising her two year old sister since she was just six days old. This character captured my heart and I had hoped to see more of her in A Heart's Home but she didn't appear.<br /><br />I would highly recommend the &#34;Journey of the Heart&#34; series to anyone who enjoys reading clean historical novels set during the settling of the old west.<br /><br />On a 5-Star scale = 5 Stars<br /><br />I would like to thank Litfuse Publicity and Thomas Nelson for my copy of A Heart's Home.

Last week, amid my Christmas book-buying frenzy, I picked up Nancy Werlin's Impossible as a gift to myself, and what a gift it was.    Lucy, the 17-year-old main character, is fighting a centuries-old family curse based on the impossible tasks in the folk song \\""Scarborough Fair.\\""  She has nine months to solve the riddles of the ballad, to save herself and her unborn child.   Unlike her mother and her mother's mother before her, Lucy has the support of a loving foster family and a devoted childhood friend, but still, she knows she's fighting a battle that her ancestors have all lost.    It's been a long time since I've rooted quite so hard for characters in a novel, but Lucy won my heart.  I loved her, and I love the story Nancy Werlin wove around her.  Impossible has it all -- an impossible task (three, actually), a fantastically alluring villain, a brave heroine, a tension-filled plot, and one of the sweetest romances you'll ever encounter.  As I write this review, the wind is whipping through the trees outside, transporting me back to that chapter where Lucy and Zach were -- wait a minute...that would be a spoiler, and that's no good.  I better just stop there. Trust me...you'll want to read every word of this gem yourself.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

It is set on the uncertain world of Quofum, which occasionally vanished from its solar system.  When a probe returned to Science Central with its data and startling news, a team was sent to the planet to perform a preliminary investigation.    In this novel, Nicholai Boylan is the captain and crew of the KK-drive starship Dampier.  He is a gruff man with an obsession with trivial detail.  In other words, he is the perfect captain of a longrange starship.    Salvador Araza is a technician who maintains all the various equipment that the scientists will use on the expedition.  He has little to do with the starship itself, which is mostly self-repairing.  However, he does an adequate job on other maintenance and repair.    Esra Tellenberg, Moselstrom (Mosi) N'kosi, Tiare Haviti and Valnadireb are xenologists.  Valnadireb is a Thranx, Tiare is a woman and the other two are men.  All four are polymaths, scientific generalists with varied skills.  Still, they all have the focused attention of true scientists.      In this story, the expedition finds Quofum in the expected orbit within the system.  They leave the Daimper in orbit around the planet and shuttle down the items necessary for their mission and comfort.  Boylan and Araza do most of the work of establishing the camp, for all four xenologists rush out to do their studies as soon as the captain will allow them to go forth.    Venturing out in separate directions, the two teams both find different sapients near the camp.  In later explorations, they find even more sapients.  The planet seems to be overfull of thinking beings.    Quofum also contains a wide diversity of flora and other fauna.  They find plants and animals whose metabolisms are based on carbon, silicon or sulfates.  They start considering the possibility of seeding from other planets.    Then the four xenologists take a boat up the river to contact one of the sapient species.  They arrive in time to see a raid on the village by two other species.  The fuzzies and stick-jellies are defending the village from the spikers and hardballs.    While the scientists are gone, Araza has a confrontation with Boylan and kills him.  Returning to the base camp, the xenologists discover the captain's body.  Then they find Araza preparing to take the shuttle and depart the planet.    Araza explains his reason for the killing to the returned scientists.  As he turns to leave, Tellenberg draws against the technician and is also killed.  The remaining three scientists are now stranded on the planet.    This tale leaves the scientists nothing else to do besides involving themselves in their work.  They all explore the immediate vicinity of the base.   After a long while -- weeks, months or maybe years -- Valnadireb continues studies near the base, but Tiare takes the skimmer to the north and Mosi rides a scooter south to expand the explorations.    Tiare finds more sapients and evidence of two higher civilizations.  Mosi finds something even stranger.  All three meet at the base and decide to investigate Mosi's discovery.    This story is a direct precursor to [[ASIN:0345496078 Flinx Transcendent]], the last Flinx novel.  Apparently it is necessary to provide a clue to the solution that Flinx has been searching for in the last several books.  Enjoy!    Highly recommended for Foster fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of planetary exploration, scientific mysteries, and stunning discoveries.    -Arthur W. Jordin","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

The author’s use of language and imagery completely transported me to the beautiful yet savage environment of the Assam tea plantations and brought a world to life that I had never seen before. At the beginning of that novel we meet Layla’s kind and free-thinking grandfather, a man that raised Layla to be just as educated and self-possessed as any man. At a time when this way of thinking is nearly unheard of, Biren Roy has become a well-respected man known for his unwavering support of equality for the women of India, especially involving education. But how did he become this man? Flame Tree Road is Biren’s story of love, heartache and a passion born from tragedy that is just as beautiful as its predecessor.<br /><br />Flame Tree Road begins in a small village in 1870s India with Biren’s family living a relatively poor yet loving and happy life. His parents have never been supporters of the country’s traditions that support cruel treatment and inequality towards women and Biren grows up dreaming of a different world. When his father dies and his mother is ostracized from everyone, including her family, and stripped from her position in society and her very humanity simply because she is a widow, smart and sensitive Biren knows his purpose in life must be to change these antiquated customs and ensure that the women of India can have a life of their own and the education they deserve regardless of their caste, their money or their marriage status.<br /><br />The bulk of the novel deals with Biren’s journey to have his dream of equality and education for women realized. This takes him to England, where he becomes a lawyer and seeks to make changes within the British government that now rules over India, then back to India where he works to make sure those changes can become a reality. I hate to say it but I found Biren’s journey slow moving and, at times, tiresome. As would be expected, there are a lot of political and societal issues and delays that make this passion of Biren’s difficult to bring to fruition. While this helps highlight for the reader the odd traditions and superstitions of old-world India (to our modern eyes at least), after a while I became as frustrated as Biren clearly was at the obstacles that kept getting in his way. The relationships he develops along the way take a backseat to this journey and felt somewhat lackluster until he falls in love with Maya, the independent daughter of an Indian educator Biren works with to build a school for Indian girls, and by the time that beautiful relationship comes to be it isn’t given enough time to really flourish. Once Biren and Maya marry the story progresses at a rapid pace, covering many years in a short amount of pages, and, for me, wraps up too quickly. On top of that, I was saddened to see Biren’s life marked largely by tragedy as he lost so many of those he loved along the way. I get the idea that for a person to appreciate the sweet they must experience the sour, but it seemed like kind Biren got the short end of the stick there.<br /><br />All of this isn’t to say I didn’t enjoy Flame Tree Road. Shona Patel’s writing is amongst the most beautiful I have come across and her abilities to bring to life a brightly colored world of beauty against the ugliness of this time and place in history (at least when it comes to the rights of women and an antiquated caste system) is unmatched in my reading. She perfectly shows how this free-thinking man becomes stuck between two worlds – the old world beliefs of India and the advancements and changes of England – and I very much enjoyed seeing how Biren reconciled these two parts of his life together. He is a remarkable character and I feel quite satisfied that Ms. Patel gave fans of Teatime for the Firefly the history of one of the most enigmatic characters from that novel.<br /><br />At the end of the day I think Flame Tree Road is a very solid novel that just fell slightly short of my very high expectations given how much I loved its predecessor. Regardless, I am still a huge fan of Shona Patel and will continue to read whatever she writes. Given her remarkably beautiful writing, I don’t think anyone could go wrong in picking up her novels.is life together.

In fact, I believe this series was among the first that I decided to read when I began reading historical romance novels after a 20 year absence from the genre.  And, believe me, most of the &#34;acceptable&#34; historical romance novels in this day and age do not include some of the rakehell behavior the hero of this story (if you care to give him that title) Nicholas, Lord Monteith, finds acceptable in his every day life.<br /><br />***SPOILERS***<br />Yes, Nicholas thinks it's okay to debauch virgins - in fact, apparently three so far. That wouldn't include sleeping with anyone and everyone he can get his hands on among the society ladies.  But, he is kinda picky - tires easily of these women and after two or three weeks moves on to more interesting fare.<br /><br />When one of his amours decides to jilt him before he can jilt her, he decides it would be fun to kidnap her and lock her up for a few hours.  Problem is, he mistakenly kidnaps Regan of the Malory Clan who is feisty enough to simply wait and see the look of surprise on his face when he returns home.  He does, they joke around a bit and he returns her back to the family fold, albeit both are strongly attracted to one another.<br /><br />But... alas his former paramour outs Nicholas and Regan by bragging that he still wants her so much, he attempted to kidnap her and got Regan instead which leaves the Malory Clan hungering for blood.  Anthony Malory wants to &#34;meet&#34; him and shoot him in his private parts.  James Malory, black sheep of the family, unaware of the situation with Nicholas and Regan is out for Nicholas' blood for other reasons - apparently Nicholas sank one of James', aka the &#34;pirate&#34; Black Hawke ships. Regan, tired of the marriage mart game and being strongly attracted to Nicholas, seeing in him the same traits as two of her uncles - Anthony and James - has a hankering to marry Nicholas.<br /><br />After this, get ready for a looooooooooooooooooooooong misunderstanding which is compounded by small misunderstandings throughout the book.  Ugh!! Double Ugh!!  One thing I did like about Regan was her positive spirit when she was horribly mistreated.  One thing I did not like is that she didn't make Nicholas pay for his continual ill treatment of her - not even a little bit - just sassy talking.derstanding which is compounded by small misunderstandings throughout the book.

The following quote is illustrative:<br /><br />The “golden rule” of interpretation requires that we extend the same courtesy to any text or author that we would want others to extend to our statements and writings (Matt. 7:12). p. 18<br /><br />In other words, texts are not just free-floating utterances that are up for grabs. They have authors (or speakers), who in turn had intentions when they wrote communicated the words, and it is our “ethical” responsibility to read the Bible on its own terms. This is the goal of hermeneutics–we the readers must read the text in order to recover the author’s intention. While this may sound obvious, contemporary practice demonstrates it to be anything but. While we are adamantly opposed to being misunderstood or having our words twisted out of context, we somehow feel free to do this very thing with the Word of God. “Reader response” hermeneutics is practiced by most, whether consciously or not, and it is into this context that Köstenberger and Patterson offer a better way.<br /><br />To lead us out of misreading Scripture, the authors have given us something fresh in their “hermeneutical triad”, i.e. the threefold grid through which to organize our study of the Scriptures. The historical, literary, and theological dimensions. The bulk of the work falls under the second, literature, which itself forms a triad of canon, genre, and language.<br /><br />Methods for better understanding the Bible are just as important now as ever. Sound hermeneutics is under assault in our individualistic, “you read it your way and I’ll read it mine” world. I asked in the introduction, “Do we really need another introductory volume on hermeneutics?” Need is a strong word. But I would say that such volumes continue to serve a good purpose, as long as they present sound interpretive methodology in a fresh, engaging way that can reach more and more people. The Bible is where we find the truest, infallible revelation of God…and of ourselves. And if we don’t know how to read it, then we lose a lot (to put it mildly). So any book that could help another generation read the Bible in a sound, ethical, responsible way is a welcome contribution as far as I am concerned. For the Love of God’s Word fits that description.<br /><br />See my full review here: https://writness.wordpress.com/2015/08/15/for-the-love-of-gods-word-by-kostenberger-and-patterson/","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

Sydney Higgins provides wonderful descriptions of how he surmises the plays ran, including placement around the open air theatres of the many pavilions for principal parts (heaven, hell, torturers, saints, dukes and so on) and more particularly how the large audiences (as described by Carew in 1602) were accommodated.  The author provides very convincing arguments, moving through the surviving medieval scripts scene by scene, highlighting important dialogue, the progress between scenes and the movement in and out of the round of extraordinary props (moving mountains, ships, the fire-belching jaws of hell, god descending and returning to heaven in a cloud, the flight of souls to heaven).  What an amazing spectacle which the author brings to life.  This is a well illustrated book, with staging directions and many works of art depicting similar medieval dramas.<br /><br />And my favourite insight from the book – the plays were of course written and presented in Cornish, with the only English being exclaimed by Lucifer when he is ejected from heaven and by Cain when he kills Abel.  Must have been most amusing for the Cornish audience that the arch-baddies both spoke English!","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

Spielman has lived in New Orleans for forty years.  He stayed there during Katrina, bunkered down with the Poor Clare nuns in a monastery in Uptown.  And he stayed there through the aftermath, taking photographs, some of which appeared in his 2007 book \\""Katrinaville Chronicles\\"".  A few years later, he got the idea for this book:  to document the long-term effects of the hurricane, many of which have been exacerbated by the passage of time and human neglect.  Spielman sees the aftereffects of Katrina as similar to the devastation wrought by the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl, and he determined to record those aftereffects similar to the way Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Gordon Parks, and others documented the Great Depression.<br /><br />Some of the most famous photographs of the Great Depression were, deliberately, political statements.  Spielman tried to avoid that as he walked around New Orleans with his Leica:  \\""This was to be a pictorial record of what I was finding.  I needed and wanted to show what was, without adding my text, my interpretations, or my reflections of suffering individuals or the governing authorities.\\""  Another objective was to cover all the areas of the city that were affected, in part to dispel the \\""misconception created by mainstream media that the floodwaters were localized mainly to the Lower Ninth Ward.\\""<br /><br />The result, THE KATRINA DECADE, is powerful -- and ineffably sad.  Before Katrina, New Orleans was my favorite city in the United States (to visit -- I would not have wanted to live there).  I have not been able to muster the gumption to go there since August 2005.  With the upcoming tenth anniversary of Katrina, there has been a spate of media coverage about the miraculous recovery of the Big Easy -- Le Bon Temps Rouler!  Spielman's photographs underscore how misleading that publicity is for the city as a whole.<br /><br />Most of the photographs were taken in 2013 and 2014.  They all are in black-and-white (Spielman quotes Robert Frank:  \\""Black and white are the colors of photography.  To me they symbolize the alternatives of hope and despair to which mankind is forever subjected.\\"").  With few exceptions the subjects are buildings -- houses, businesses, schools, and hospitals.  With blown-out windows, missing roofs and clapboard siding, graffiti'd and vandalized, out-of-plumb, and being reclaimed by nature.  (Vines appear everywhere, in a number of photos starting from the roof and growing down so that they are in advanced stages of enveloping the building.)<br /><br />For those who care about New Orleans -- all of New Orleans and all of its people -- THE KATRINA DECADE should not be missed.Robert Frank:  \\""Black and white are the colors of photography.

When I finally decided to read it, however, I was delightfully surprised by the engaging and well-written storyline.  This book traces about thirty years of history in Afghanistan, first through the eyes of Mariam, a girl wed to a man thirty years her senior.  Mariam was born a harami, a bastard daughter born out of wedlock to a household servant and hidden away to conceal the father's shame.  When her mother dies, Mariam's father, to escape the wrath of his wives (he has three) forces her to marry a shoemaker named Rasheed and move to a different city.  Mariam, who was born to a poor life to begin with, can only watch as her life deteriorates further when she is unable to produce any children for her husband.  Ten years later, we pick up the story again through the eyes of Laila, a young girl born to a neighbor of Mariam's.  The ongoing wars kill Laila's parents when she is just fourteen, and she is taken in by Rasheed, who is struck by her beauty and has plans of taking her as a second wife.  When Laila discovers that she's pregnant by a childhood sweetheart who has also been killed by the war, she assents to be Rasheed's wife, not knowing what she is getting herself into.<br /><br />This book continues through the eyes of Mariam and Laila, as they form an unlikely friendship and care for each other and eventually Laila's children and try to protect each other from their abusive husband.  The situation in Afghanistan continues to deteriorate for women, and watching as life gets harder and harder for these spirited two was deeply moving to me.  The language is rich, the characters fleshed-out, the dialogue realistic, and the story heartbreaking and uplifting all at once.  I love a book that draws me in so deeply that I have to actively clear it from my head in between reading sessions, and this one had just that effect on me.  Reading this book had me smelling the spices they cooked with, feeling the burden of wearing a burqa, and hearing the constant explosions of a seemingly never-ending war.  The ending was ultimately bittersweet for me.  This book will make you think deeply about the cultural differences that still exist in the world to this day; it certainly gave me a better understanding of Afghanistan, and that's something I feel a lot of people could benefit from.ey cooked with, feeling the burden of wearing a burqa, and hearing the constant explosions of a seemingly never-ending war.

The author blends the age old Biblical mystery surrounding Cain's curse and/or his \\""mark\\"" and the first murder weapon (all of which are unnamed in the Bible) with a modern myth surrounding the unsolved murder of Jerry Siegel's father (the creator of Superman).<br /><br />At the heart of the story is a son whose life is interrupted at age nine by the accidental death of his bi-polar mother at the hands of his ill-tempered father.  The father is imprisoned and offers no contact with the child. Nineteen years pass when on a seemingly random call to rescue a homeless man, father and son are haphazardly reunited, and the roller coaster ride begins.  The father has been shot; they whisk him away to a hospital where suspicious characters emerge.  In the span of a few pages, our \\""heroes\\"" are afoot -- ducking bullets and alligators in the Florida swamps, running for their lives to avoid murder charges of a federal agent, and following a myriad of clues which lead to Cleveland, Ohio in an effort to solve the mystery and clear their names -- all while the police, a customs agent, and an evil, psychotic, Hemlock-wielding henchman (who has an equally vicious dog) are in hot pursuit.<br /><br />The results are a little overreaching at times -- cliffhanger endings at the end of each chapter, too many coincidences to the point that I lost count, and a host of cardboard, melodramatic characters are used to buoy and move the story.  However, if you can keep an open mind and have a love of suspense, I think you'll be moderately entertained with this fairly easy read.<br /><br />Reviewed by Phyllis<br />APOOO BookClub","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

I’ve had his big Collected Poems since it was published in 2001 and have never gotten far into it without giving up.  I took up Langdon Hammer’s new biography of Merrill in the hope that it would help me, but it too gave me trouble.  Merrill comes off as a spoiled, effete little brat who would have benefited from having to take a job and earn a living.  What saves the book is the richness and interest you get when a biographer includes any detail that readers are likely to find juicy:  Visiting Venice, Merrill and his partner David Jackson keep company with Chester Kallman and one Alex Ansen.  “Ansen, crossing literary party lines, was both a friend of Auden’s and an honorary Beat – in fact the model for characters in Jack Kerouac’s On the Road (Rollo Greb) and William Burroughs’ Naked Lunch (A.J. )  Merrill tucked a sketch of him in a letter to (John) Hollander, who was a friend of Ansen’s too: ‘Sometimes he is wearing a bright red double-breasted suit, sometimes a white one.  After midnight he is apt to be sound asleep in Ciro’s where nothing wakes him, not even a sharp prod from an umbrella.’ ”  In winter 1960, Merrill, Howard Moss and others amused themselves by writing rhymes on Proustian themes, to be sung to the tune of “Colonel Bogey’s March” from the movie The Bridge on the River Kwai.  One Bernie Weinbaum contributed one in which the child Proust addresses his nanny:  “Francoise, why must I go to bed?   I’d rather play with girls instead.   Later   I’ll have a waiter,   But only after my grandmother’s dead.”  To be fair, although James Merrill’s aestheticism is often cloying, it is also on occasion sublime, as when in Austria in 1968 he sees Vermeer’s The Artist in His Studio for the first time and writes to young painter David McIntosh:  “Within a quarter hour, it took its place among the wonders of the world.  When I was little my mother used to say that there was a heaven where pets went after death.  Vermeer makes you believe in a heaven for things and textures – cracked leather, brass, paper, silk, yarn.  …  I felt like singing with joy when I saw, in the upper right hand corner, barely visible, the lightly painted tangle of untrimmed threads: the back of the tapestry! as if to say in the softest voice, that no miracle is separable from its humble accidents, its seamy side.”  When Hammer interjects an opinion, he’s generally smart about it, as when he calls a scene in Merrill’s memoir A Different Person “too artful to be wholly accurate and yet too vivid to be wholly invented.”  Hammer has done his homework, and he writes well.  The trouble with the book is the subject.  In the 1970s, Merrill and Richard Howard, a poet who rivaled him in ornateness and difficulty, gave a joint reading in North Dakota.  As they buckled up for the flight back to New York, Merrill remarked, “Now the Great Plains have met the Great Fancies.”  What is enjoyable about Merrill and what is insufferable about him are both contained in that observation.","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

In theory, you will be happiest if you decorate your home with the colors in your category's palette.<br /><br />Personally, I found that I equally preferred three categories, which is frustrating since not all the palettes go well together. Don't expect this book to solve your entire color dilemma, but it certainly will give you a nudge in the right direction! Importantly, it gives you tips on HOW to use color in your home. It goes room by room to demonstrate using the different palettes, and even has a few tips and tricks to easy decorating.<br /><br />Another, very similar book is: [[ASIN:1577172027 Your Colors Your Home: Decorating with Colors That Reflect Your Personality]], but overall, I think I prefer this one.<br /><br />Definitely recommended.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

Well, one may come to expect sequels may kind of be repetitive but I expect at least some twists from the first one.    Unfortunately, the only twists provided by Jack Ketchum was a twist towards the downside. This book lack the flavor of the first one in the following areas:    1) Dramatic - OffSeason was so much more dramatic, including all the unexpected deaths. In OffSpring, almost the majority survived, which is totally out of character based on Jack's writing style.    2) Cruelty - Well, forget about biting off the balls, eating the liver. Apart from the first few pages, the rest was just plain sailing. Gunshots, screams but nothing more.    3) Story line - It was almost the same, wasn't it. Before you flip on the next page, you kind of anticipate what was coming. Just that it didn't really materialize, because as I said, it was so much lesser in terms of contents compared to the first one.    To round it up, I think if Jack comes out with a 3rd sequel to this, say OffSummer, I will definitely think before grabbing one this time.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

As just about everything I have to say about this book has probably been covered in the previous 159 reviews, I'll limit this to some minutiae and a couple big picture observations.<br /><br />How many others have managed no fewer than five teams that were all winners?  In 19 seasons managing those five clubs, Billy Martin had six first-place finishes, going on to win two pennants and one World Series:<br /><br />- Minnesota Twins in 1968 : 79 wins and 83 losses. Martin took over in 1969 and they finished first in their division, winning 97 and losing 65.<br /><br />- Detroit Tigers in 1970: 79 wins, 83 losses. Martin took over in '71 and they finished second in their division, and in '72 finished first.<br /><br />- Texas Rangers in 1972: 54 wins, 100 losses. Martin's first full season, 1974, they finished second in their division, 84 wins and 76 losses.<br /><br />- Oakland A's in 1979: 54 wins, 108 losses. Martin took over in 1980 and they finished second in their division and in '81 finished first in the first half of the season, second in the second half.<br /><br />- New York Yankees, which won the pennant in 1976 and '77 and the World Series in '77 under Martin.<br /><br />But most impressive to me is how Billy Martin turned lousy clubs like Minnesota, Detroit, Texas, and Oakland into contenders so quickly. The Yankees were already pretty good when he took over.<br /><br />The great irony of Billy Martin is how the autocratic American workplace was perfect for his style as a team manager but cost him his job every time because of short-sighted decision-making by the one autocrat who overruled him, the club owner.<br /><br />Last but not least, look at this book's picture of Billy Martin managing the Twins and let me know if you stare at it and keep turning back to it, as I did.  This was a man who called the shots.<br /><br />Read  BILLY MARTIN: BASEBALL'S FLAWED GENIUS.","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

I do however hope the next book makes it on the shelf soon. I am addicted to the books.<br />  Again, Martin doesn't disappoint. A perfect blend of action, death, intrigue, and a few twists and turns in it.<br />  As I've said before, you don't have to be a fantasy fan to like this series.<br />  Still love Roy Dotrice as the narrator.<br /><br />Might want to check out Daughter if the Blood by Anne Bishop, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings Trilogy by JRR Tolkien, and The Furies of Calderon by Jim Butcher.","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

It was about all I was looking for in a narrative history of the Federal League--written in a straightforward manner without rhetorical flourishes.  However, in the final analysis, I couldn't rate the book five stars as it is missing some material I would have expected--there are no appendices of player stats, typical lineups, games schedules and scores, or standngs.  There is much of this material in the book, but it is scattered throught the text, and is not complete by any means.    The text of 340 pages is divided into an introduction, followed by 51 chapters and an epilogue.  A quick calculation shows that the chapters are short, averaging about six pages each.  Only a bit more that half of the chapters are on the pennant races themselves.  There are endnotes, mainly giving references;  only a few expand on the text.  From the endnotes, the reader can see that the author has done extensive research consulting sources from the time of the Federal League.     Very worthwhile for anyone who wants to learn about the Federal League and the personalities involved;  less so for someone mainly interested in statistical data.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

The message requests that he help a Church in Seville that has already killed two people to protect itself.  The powers of the Curia are more than upset about the hacker and the Church.  So they send an agent of the former \\""Inquisition\\"" to Seville to find out what is going on.    When the agent gets to Seville, he finds that the Church of Our Lady of Tears has indeed had two mysterious deaths in the last few months.  The Church itself is a sixteenth century building that is slowly falling apart.  Among those trying to save it are an old Priest who still does Mass in Latin, a member of the old Spanish Gentry and her daughter, and an American Nun who is on indefinite leave from her order.      The stories that are intertwined with the mystery and the history of the Church are interesting and well done.  There is even a group of 'bad guys' who are funnier than they should be - a Gypsy Singer, a former Bantamweight contender for the Spanish title, and a former fake-lawyer from Havana who fled with the fall of Batista.  The true bad guys are the estranged husband of the Duchess' daughter, who wants the property for his bank and the Bishop of Seville, who wants the money from the property to enhance his own personal power.      Perez-Reverte does a fine job and with a subtle and deft hand.  My one complaint is that all the good guys are noble and good looking, while the bad guys are all conniving ugly leaches.

Accompanied by Raven (who had previously--erroneously--been Wicked John's companion), a glued-back-together Humpty Dumpty (with one key missing eggshell piece), and the Pathetic Fallacy, he's off to get the loot.<br /><br />But Jackie-boy and his sometimes quite-reluctant crew are gonna have to deal with another quester crossing their path: One of the Page sisters who has a personal mission into Americana, and she's got a regrowing Paul Bunyan and the hilarious Babe the Blue Ox (still having snarfolicious fantasy adventures in his own head) for bodyguards.<br /><br />If you like zombies, be prepared for a hilarious use of them (and a social commentary, no doubt, about the \\""good old days\\"" of the American pre-sixties heydays). A new character--powerful and sinister--is met up with, too. There's a touch of roaring 20's speakeasy days fun as well. And boinking, cause it's Jack, after all.<br /><br />When Jack's Americana adventure is concluded, there's a detour to a one-shot story: \\""Gary Does Denmark,\\"" where the Pathetic Fallacy tries to put on Hamlet with Fabley folk, and you know it's just not gonna go easy or work out normally.<br /><br />Enjoy.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

He has beautiful gift for words, character development, and emotional imagery. He has some vivid descriptions of the passion of love and the beauty of life. As many critics complain, Hardy seems to view life with some skepticism. He seems to believe that life is hard and people sometimes are not treated fairly by the very ones who should be there to help and protect the hurting. This philosophy parallels the feeling of many people that the Church has hurt them. A friend of mine wrote an impassioned essay about the personal pain she and others had experienced through transgressions of the Church.<br /><br />The difference is that she recognized a loving, all-knowing God who loves us deeply and whose love is sometimes not reflected in his people - whereas Hardy's story reflects the world's perception that a callous church represents an absent God. Still, I detect in his writing a subtle thread of hope as reflected by the hope of his characters, though not by their plight. I appreciated this book because it made me realize I am the hands and feet for the people in the world whose hope is gone.<br /><br />Anyone who hurts for others will be as greatly frustrated if you read this book. But you will also gain so much if you keep the perspective that God is in control and cares deeply about every person's plight. In this story, I see the undying faith Tess had in Clare as a picture of the way our faith in Christ should be, and the kind of love I want to have in another person.<br /><br />Tess' pain would not have been so hard to bear if the church had acted toward her as Jesus acted toward tax collectors and sinners in Luke 15, and as the people in those three parables acted. If the Church had applied the anxious determination of one who has lost an important object, Tess would have received the support she needed during her time of hurt. It makes me ponder the question: What will I do for the hurting Tess's of the world?uring her time of hurt.

Boyle recounts the events of the couple of days after the Sweets moved into a white Detroit neighborhood; Ossian Sweet's life to that point; the NAACP's involvement in preparing for the trials; and the brilliant performance of Clarence Darrow in both trials.    For the most part, this book reads like a novel, which would have had a happy ending if not for the epilogue reminding us that lives of African Americans very rarely ended happily for much of our history. Boyle's descriptions of the Sweets and their friends defending the house, as well as the goings-on outside the house, was edge-of-your-seat intense. He provided plenty of background on everyone involved, which helps the reader get into the story and care about the outcome.    Boyle also did a wonderful job of telling the racial history of Detroit, something students are unlikely to learn in the classroom. And he succeeded in bringing Darrow to life and explaining why the Great Defender wanted to be a part of the Sweet case. In so many ways, this book is a gem.    I have a couple of small complaints that only slightly, if at all, detract from the overall quality of the book. First, I did feel at times that Boyle strayed from the topic. I realize the Sweets were not the sole focus of the book, that the bigger picture of race and the impact of the NAACP were important as well. Still, I thought he occasionally drifted. And the other issue I had was that I thought Boyle fell into a trap that catches many historians -- hyperbole and assumption. I cringe when historians claim to know what someone was thinking at a certain moment some decades ago, and I believe a good story tells itself and doesn't need flowery language to make it interesting. In some instances, I wish Boyle had simply stuck to the known facts.    But these criticisms are insignificant, and the truth is, I loved the book. I learned a great deal from it and whenever I had to put it down, I was always eager to pick it back up. I'd recommend it to anyone.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

It is the sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Ernest Hemingway (and many others) called it the greatest American novel ever. Huck Finn picks up right where Tom Sawyer left off - Huck's abusive father appears to lay claim to Huck's fortune, so Huck fakes his own death and goes down the Mississippi River with Jim, the escaped slave.<br /><br />Much like Tom Sawyer, there's not a lot of plot going on here most of the time, and that's okay, because Twain's writing is extremely entertaining. Twain has a good old time mocking social conventions, and the novel is gripping almost all the way through. Hemingway was right: the end of Huck Finn is poor. After Jim is abducted and Tom Sawyer reappears, things just get silly, not to mention highly convenient (And Tom Sawyer here is just as immature as he ever was, reinforcing that no real maturation occurred in Tom Sawyer, and that that book really isn't a coming-of-age story in the truest sense).<br /><br />Twain has made Huck the narrator. On the whole, this works, although it gets tiresome to read Huck's dialect sometimes. Twain-as-narrator is definitely missed here. Nobody could write a clever sentence like Twain, and most of that is lost here, although occasionally Huck will turn one (and by doing so break character, but that's the price you pay).<br /><br />Huck Finn has been exceedingly controversial because of the extensive use of the n-word. So is the novel racist? Certainly the characters have the racism of the day ingrained in them - in that sense, it is racist. But more important to most people is whether Twain was racist; that is, whether he put his own personal racism in the book. That is harder to determine, especially since Twain has made Huck the narrator. Perhaps the fairest thing to say is that Twain was genuinely criticizing racism, but the way in which he portrayed Jim and the other characters contains some residual racism of its own.<br /><br />So is Huck Finn America's greatest novel? Well, maybe not. But it's definitely up there.ism of its own.<br /><br />So is Huck Finn America's greatest novel? Well, maybe not. But it's definitely up there.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

So far there are 4 books in this series, with the 5th scheduled to come out Jan'09.  Overall the latest I read is that there are 8 books planned for the series right now.  This was another great book.<br /><br />Team Jaz finds themselves shipped over to the middle east to help Jaz's twin brother, Dave, take out a terrorist called the Wizard.  Dave has identified a mole in his Special Ops team and it is up to Jaz, Cassandra, Bergman, and Vayl to figure out who the mole is and assassinate the Wizard.  There are lots of awesome fight scenes, lots of reavers, and some new baddies.  Jaz and Vayl go through a lot of character development both individually and as a pair.  A very fast-paced book, the setting in the Middle East is timely and gives incite into the culture there (as if we don't already know a lot about the culture there).<br /><br />This was a great book. For the most part I think it was executed excellently.  I love the characters, I love how they all have histories and interesting personalities.  There were a couple of minor irritations in this book.  One was Vayl's obsessiveness with the search for his boys, the second is the number of things that are happening at once and how they prevent the story from flowing as well as it could have.  These are minor quibbles and overall it was an excellent read.<br /><br />I am excited to read the next book, but reluctant to read it because then it means I have to wait until the next book is published for more Jaz.  I am trying to decide if I should put off reading the next Jaz Parks book so that I can prolong my Jaz-fix :-)","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

We have a story of a natural cavern that has become a local tourist attraction in upstate New York named after the family that has owned the cavern for generations, the Mordock's.  The story takes place immediately when the power inside the caverns (which are about 50 yards below the surface) go out during one of the hourly tours.  During the setup, we are introduced to a number of characters both normal folks and also sociopaths.      The story breaks into two story arcs, the first is of the group underground and what do they do while they wait for the power to come on (which runs the elevators back to the surface).  Will it take hours?  What happens if something has occurred above that will not allow them to be rescued in a short amount of time?  Should they find another way out?  The second story arc is that of a few folks up above at the cavern's hotel and of what is happening up there, and their concern for their family members that are below in the cavern touring when it comes to their attention that their safety and rescue may not be as immediate as they first hoped.    Why is this story just plain great?  Suspense.  Fast paced.  Realism (for a horror story with little suspension of disbelief required).  And no characters seemed to be arbitrary survivors; the reader was kept guessing.  The remoteness of the hotel and cavern make the need of some protagonists to act quicker than the fire, medical, and rescue crews; this allows it to be realistic with little contrivance.    It should be noted there is a horror in this novel that is more disturbing than a supernatural force, making the horror so much more real, but also the darkness of the caves and their atmosphere makes the novel even more chilling.  The sociopathic characters are also frightful and since they are not necessarily the true antagonistsof the story, this makes them even more disturbing.  And the chapters that show us the lead up to the electrical power outage are first class action packed suspense.      At a short length and nonstop suspense, with great technique in flashbacks, and the creation of an interesting backstory behind the caverns and the horror that may reside within them truly make a top notch novel of the utmost quality.  Highly, highly recommended.  In all honesty, one of the most exciting, frightful, and best novels I have read in a long time.  The only thing that is confusing is why I never heard of it prior to this and why it was not a best seller like a Koontz or King book.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

Kept me on pins and needles, now I am anxiously waiting for the next book in this series!<br /><br /> So many surprises in this book, from seeing some of the characters of Starry Night put in an appearance, to meeting new characters to love and cheer on. I was excited when I saw and recognized them.  A heartwarming story full of love, forgiveness, and second chances, as we are taken back to Cedar Cove.<br /><br /> This is the 4th book in the Rose Harbor series, but could be read as a stand-alone, as the author does a fabulous job catching us up on what is happening. This series always leaves me wanting to visit this bed and breakfast in Cedar Cove (fictitious place).<br /><br /> Jo Marie is left heartbroken as handyman Mark leaves town.  Coco and Katie come to stay the weekend, as they plan on attending their 10 year high school reunion. Both Coco and Katie have special reasons, wrongs they would like to correct, for attending this reunion.<br /><br /> I am a HUGE Debbie Macomber fan and will be watching for the next book in this series.

Unfortunately, it does not rise to the classic.    Set in Tennessee, it is the tale of two hick brothers who amass a fortune in banking and improbably bring a world's fair to the fair city they made their home after leaving the farm.  One runs for governor which allows the hiring of a consultant who becomes the factotem who tells the yarn - a familiar device.  Of course, the brothers are scorned by the old southern aristocracy as nouveau riche.  Never accepted, they plow onward and upward.  Their wives have the same problem of fitting in, of course.  They spend their way into \\""society\\"" all the while playing politics and womanizing.  The brothers mistresses kept popping up, but frankly, did not add much to the book.  It seemed as if the author was trying to make some grand statement with the \\""other\\"" women, especially since one of the brother's mistresses was once his dame.  The statement fell far short of grand.  The brothers' fall is as predictable as the rest of the book.    Predictable is the adjective that best describes the plot and the characters.  There is very little that is surprising.  It is an often told tale of rising too fast and taking the fall.  Moreover, the brothers are amazingly uninteresting as characters.  Mike - the consultant - is somewhat interesting, although he annoyingly repeatedly lamented that he is a great judge of character but had just misjudged a character.    More annoying, are the brief chapters that are mixed in that vary in form as screenplays, second person recitations, poems, and the like.  This was pure overwriting.    Other than those gimmick chapters, the writing is generally good.  It is the predictability that brought the book down.  It just seemed an attempt to rewrite a classic and set it in the 21st century - like a poor colorization of a black and white.  This is not to say that this is a terrible book.  It is just good, and no more.  It did make me want to revisitRobert Penn Warren, however.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

Most of the book is taken up in rhetorical rants agaisnt fundamentalist Christianity, and most of the rest is used to convey Mencken's contradictory views about the social climate of Dayton, TN (where he oscillates between suggesting that the people are suprisingly decent to calling Dayton a \\""ninth-rate country town.\\"") Anyone hoping to learn about the Scopes trial will find little here. the book is a good supplement to one's knowledge of the Scopes trial, but not a good educational tool.<br /><br />Do not get me wrong. As one who shares Mencken's disdain for Fundamentalist Christianity (and any attempt at an anti-evolution law), I found his verbal jabs and witticisms delightful. It was also a delight to read the complete transcript (the last section of the book) where Clarence Darrow dismantles William Bryan's Biblical literalism. But I will warn prospective readers that as most of the writing in this book is five-to-seven page editorial pieces, they can be rather repititious and (towards the end) monotonous.<br /><br />In the end, I will reccomend this book to those who, like myself, are already quite knowledged about the events of the Scopes trial. As such, a one-volume  collection of Mencken's writings on the trial offers a welcome supplement. If you are new to the trial, start elsewhere. This collection offers far more in commentary and rhetoric than reporting.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

Larry Bird and Magic Johnson were two of the most admirable and legendary players who ever played the game.  I was too young to remember the game between the Indiana State and Michigan State in 1979; however, this book has given me the chance to know what it was like leading up to that historical matchup.  The author has such a wonderful writing style that is so compelling that I had a hard time putting the book down.<br /><br />To read about the mini-biographies of Larry Bird and Earvin \\""Magic\\"" Johnson was so inspiring.  Larry Bird is a very private man and to get insight into his personal life and to know what type of success he became is inspiring.  The aura that surrounded Magic Johnson and the following that he had (does not surprise me given his charismatic and such positive air that he had).  The fine details of the matchups and statistics is satisfying for any sports history fan.  The author leads us every step of the way until game day - and the aftermath that followed.  Two storybook teams that made it to the NCAA finals against the odds - Indiana State University versus Michigan State.  That was a game that changed the history of NCAA basketball and the future of the NBA.<br /><br />VERDICT<br /><br />This is a must read!  One of the few books, in my library, that I plan to read again.  It really is hard to put down.<br /><br />Highly recommended.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

A novel peopled with characters much like ourselves or persons we've known at different stages of our lives. Reading David Nicholls' novel &#34;ONE DAY&#34; so thoroughly immersed me in the lives and emotions of people much like myself that it took me days after reading it to come up for air. And now that I've just read this novel &#34;ALL OUR YESTERDAYS&#34;, I am no less overawed at what Erik Tarloff was able to masterfully accomplish. That is, crafting a novel that, ever so subtly --- from the time of 19 year old Zeke Stern first met 18 year old Molly Hilliard (both students at the University of California-Berkeley) at a house party both Zeke and his childhood buddy Stan Pilnik had in their Berkeley apartment in October 1968 --- captures the essence and spirit of the generation that came of age during the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War. (The party had been Stan's idea and a way for him to assert his independence from the smothering hold his parents in Los Angeles had had on him.)<br /><br />&#34;ALL OUR YESTERDAYS&#34; takes the reader from 1968 to 2014. Each chapter has a title that identifies the year or period of the characters' lives, thus allowing the reader to see how their lives are played out through the years. The novel is also very dialogue-driven, which I like a lot. Novels that are too heavily slanted toward the narrative voice can be offputting at times. Especially for me because I, as a reader, want to see and experience what the characters in the novel are saying, doing, and thinking. That is what excites me about &#34;ALL OUR YESTERDAYS.&#34; You feel that you're in the midst of REAL PEOPLE in a very intimate way and the effect is not unlike finding yourself, the reader, as &#34;the ghost in the novel.&#34; And what has special meaning for me: I could relate to the ups and downs, the shifting social and political beliefs, attitudes and mores of the major characters (Zeke & Molly, Stan, Liam, Melanie, and Corin the vainglorious revolutionary and egoist) as someone who was born shortly after President Kennedy was assassinated and remembers in varying degrees, the major events, fads, and fashions of the late 20th century.<br /><br />Many times as I read through this novel I laughed, despaired and shuddered when tragedies arose, and sometimes held my breath as the main characters grew, met challenges, and matured. For any reader who wants to read a novel that lives and breathes from the first page, you won't go wrong with &#34;ALL OUR YESTERDAYS.&#34;des and mores of the major characters (Zeke & Molly, Stan, Liam, Melanie, and Corin the vainglorious revolutionary and egoist) as someone who was born shortly after President Kennedy was assassinated and remembers in varying degrees, the major events, fads, and fashions of the late 20th century.

Perfect for : Personal reading, great host/hostess gift (for the right person!)    In a nutshell: I don't know if my family has laughed this much in quite a while - at least not because of a book! We had relatives over for dinner one evening, and I decided to pull this book out to see what they thought. What I thought would be a quick five minute browse through the book ended up lasting over an hour as we passed the book back and forth, reading the children's letters and how Santa responded to them out loud. I've never had a better time during dinner! This is the perfect gift for someone with a great sense of humor, or someone who needs one! It would also be great after a long day of work, or holiday shopping - just grab a cocktail and start reading - your day will instantly get better! As I learned, this book is also a perfect ice breaker for a gathering - just make sure there are no kids who still believe in Santa, because just like the picture on the cover - this Santa isn't your normal \\""ho, ho, ho\\"" jolly old Saint Nick, but rather a blunt pot-bellied, tattooed, cigar-smoking, drinking, cursing (not too bad) Santa who is finally telling kids exactly what he thinks!    Extended Review:  You've simply got to get this book this holiday season! If for some reason it offends you - I apologize, but I don't expect it to offend anyone. My parents were here when we read it out loud, and if anyone would have been offended, it would have been my Mom, who took everything in stride and laughed as much as the rest of us! While you are at it, pick up a copy for someone else who deserves a good laugh!    Characters: Santa is hilarious! He's pulling out all the stops and telling kids what the reality of the situation is!    Story-Line: This book is full of letters written by children to Santa, and his responses. Please note that it is NOT a book I would read to a child who still believes in Santa, or any child at all, as it is certainly filled with adult humor.    Readability: I found the book easy to read. One note here is that the kid's letters are in different fonts, and some really look like kids handwriting, which can get a bit tricky in some situations (think of the suggested cocktail above).    Overall: A holiday MUST HAVE this year, especially with the economic fears - everyone needs to laugh about something!","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

The foulness comes from Pittsfield's politicians, business interests and newspaper editorials when confronted by Bouton's honesty and decency. The love of baseball in what is quite possibly the place where the game began in America prompts Bouton and a good friend to pitch an offer the residents of Pittsfield can't refuse. But a host of hidden agendas reveal themselves as Bouton and his business partner move their proposal through the decision-making process.

Rushkoff's call for a return to core competencies is a breezy account of self-sabotaging business practices and the philosophical antidotes to them. Elegant in its simplicity but vast in its wisdom, I'd feel comfortable handing Rushkoff's book to a veteran Fortune 500 CEO or a 16-year-old paperboy.    I so enjoyed the subject, I thought HOUDINI SOLUTION might offer similar insights, but Ernie Schenck is no Doug Rushkoff. Schenck's clumsy metaphor makes a far less cogent argument to get back in the box. HOUDINI SOLUTION argues for us to surrender to the box in order to figure out how to get out of it. But where Rushkoff is holistic, Schenck is obsessed with stretching his Houdini references.     It's almost like Schenck took a few good ideas from Rushkoff and liberally sprinkled them with the magical \\""don't be it, think it\\"" asininity of THE SECRET, rather than identifying systemic problems in the way our businesses and lives work.    I'm not saying that Schenck copped his book from Rushkoff because if he had, he would have written a better book. If you're really interested in this subject, read GET BACK IN THE BOX instead.

Even the most foundational fantasy writers (McCaffrey, Lackey, Moorcock, Anthony, Pratchett) all have had their somewhat bland but then pick-up the pace books that they started with. It floored me to find that Berg was a well established author who had slipped through the cracks in my book buying binges when I looked her up after reading it.    It is a much different writing style than the Transformation series. I suspect that her past books had a different editor, maybe a better one?, who helped her cut to the chase.     The story starts bland and mundane in day-to-day medieval life with hints of more to come. That \\""more\\"", once it does come, leaves you wanting to know it all and then when you hit the point where the adventure really kicks in, the book ends and you have to find the second one. If you are a patient reader this isn't such a big deal. I've waited for a fair share of books in my day and do not need instant gratification. But if you aren't used to juggling authors or get too tightly wound into a storyline, please buy both books at once, it will save you a lot of annoyance.     If you are not a patient reader or can only read for 10-20 minutes at a time, this book will be tough in the beginning as there's only so much everyday monastery life one can read about without the single hint of magic and politics that are deep but boring.    Still when it does payout, this story flows nicely with a unique twist in the magic and a nice mystery that continues to unravel at a better pace in the second half of the book. The Fantasy side of this world intrigues me and I look forward to reading the next book.    If you haven't read Berg and you want a good introductory book, go for Transformation.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

I was disappointed.<br /><br />The majority of the book is spent identifying different kinds of bullying, and validating feelings, and it seems intended to convince the reader that there are other kinds of bullying beside the stereotypical Nelson Muntz shaking down little kids for lunch money. Maybe there are people who don't know or believe that there are other kinds of bullying; I don't know. It's useful information, but it's not what I needed, not what the title advertised, and I think it could have been half as long and just as effective.<br /><br />Finally, we got to the chapter about \\""what kids can do.\\"" There were some good ideas, but unfortunately nothing that hadn't already occurred to us or been suggested. Ideas which sadly have not worked.<br /><br />There were some strategies that I liked. I think there would be value in having kids in general read it - the kids who can probably benefit most from it are kids who have friends who are bullied. However, I'm not sure how to get those kids to read it.<br /><br />For the bully victim, it may be helpful to read these ideas in a book rather than have an adult suggest them. But some are going to be hard to apply. \\""Enlist friends\\"" only works if you have good friends to begin with. Other strategies work best on a first occurrence, and won't really help when there's an established pattern of bullying, as there likely is for any kid picking up this book. 29 slim pages don't really cover the topic well enough.<br /><br />The \\""Ask your parents\\"" section seems determined to help you with explaining to your dim parents that there are different kinds of bullying and how to identify it. I don't really see that as a problem. What IS a problem is that parents don't know how to help their kids - and the book does nothing to help. I don't really understand the point of the Pledge - it's nice language, but again, how can the parents follow through?<br /><br />I'm a little confused by the age range that is intended. It's definitely meant to be read by the child rather than a parent.

I suppose that's why they aren't so good - the language is flowery, slightly unintelligent, and overly dramatic. They are honestly entertaining books if you can just get past the mediocre writing - I think Meyers had some good ideas but no real way to get them down on paper. (Except when Edward leaves Bella in Book II - The way she shows Bella's depression with the \\""months\\"" setup is brilliant). As for them being sexist, I really don't think they are - Bella is a bit mopey, but I've been through similar horrible situations - depression is the pits.<br /><br />Granted, I think most people know that is what they are going to get. The easiest way to compare the writing style is to Harry Potter; Jk Rowling wrote those for children, and even its vocabulary blows this series out of the water. So if you're buying for your kids - buy Harry Potter, its more worth your dollar. For a teen - try a book called Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson - if you are an adult, buy Anne Rice, or the real fallback, Wuthering Heights. I suggest if you are an adult (teens should just read it - the hype is too much to avoid it for them!) - take this book what for what it is/where it is shelved in a bookstore - Teen Department.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

I can't say enough about the thought and care that has been put into this book. It is truly a must-have for anyone entering in the film festival process-- directors, producers, and publicists will find information in this volume that will undoubtedly improve the whole experience.    The book is conveniently divided into chapters that comprehensively handle each stage of the process: Before you submit, When you submit, While you wait, When you get the call, The pre-festival push, At the festival, and Aftermath.     I am finding each chapter to be deeply informative. Holland breaks up the text into easy to follow bullet points and checklists so that it can function as a field manual as well as a text that you want to read ahead of festival time. Poignant anecdotes are interjected throughout an offer insight into some of Holland's broad experience in the film festival world. The advice is current and includes tips about [...], how to deal with rejection, and what steps to take when you get in.    I strongly recommend the book to anyone out there looking for a complete and thoroughly helpful guide to what can seem like a daunting process. As a reader, I feel privileged to receive the insider's advice I get every time I open the book.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

The reader's voice was annoying and I couldn't wait for the book to be over.    As far as the book goes, I don't think it was that great. OK, you do learn some history of how warfare has been conducted over the past 2000 years. And yes, civilians are killed often - I guess this is what Carr calls terrorism. So in his view, what happened on 9/11 is not so strange in the history of warfare. We are war with Al Qaeda and terrorism is offten a major facet of war. I was not utterly convinced that 9/11 is of the same flavor of terrorism as troops overstepping boundaries during wartime. We would call that latter war crimes but the 'war on terror' is of a definitely different  sort of war. Like most things, terrorism is a term that is a spectrum of tactics and not a one size fits all definition. One must also consider motivations: is the motivation of saturation bombing the same as 9/11? It would seem to me that bombing is more to destroy an enemies resources that what 9/11 was - destroy American symbols and innocents.    Even more doubtful is Carr's contention that his widely defined terrorism ALWAYS backfires on those who use it. When it seems not to, he say for example Rome succeeded so well 'in spite of' it's terrorist tactics not because of. Yes, creating malice in people will usually cause them to be malicious. Terror is one way that can happen. But not the only and probably not the most dominant. Of course the nuclear bombing of Japan seems to contradict Carr's premise. We killed a lot of civilians which directly contributed to us winning the war against Japan. And Japan has not sought revenge since as far as I know of. Is the lesson here that a large enough act of terrorism can actually lead to success for the terrorizers? It seems truer than Carr's categorical statements.    Written in 2002, there is no comment on the Iraq War.     And did I hear him call the Byzantine Empire, the Holy Roman Empire?    Skip this one.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

Part-time deputy Frank Zucchetti talks Anderson out of his smelly hideout before anyone is injured. So opens \\""Bones of Contention,\\"" set in rural Maine's mud-time April. With the accidental discovery of a young woman's remains, a well-drawn cast of down-Maine characters, and fine dialogue, we are led into the labyrinth of a cold case that becomes increasingly warm as the plot unfolds. Dedicated sheriff Sam Barrows, \\""from away,\\"" chaffs at not being accepted by conserative Mainers, who are suspicious of all outsiders. Adding to his distress, his young wife, Darla, depressed by a miscarriage, jealously overreacts to her husband's calling in an old flame, State Police Lt. Belle Whittaker, to help work the case.  It seems that a small parcel of land that the phone company bought from the Zucchettis was the site of a store owned by the Italian Benito family, which burned down some twenty-five years ago. Through Mafia influence an investigation by the sheriff and fire departments had been thwarted to cover up clandestine gambling, narcotics dealings and prostitution. Uncovered bones are thought to be those of Anna, a promiscuous, pregnant Benito daughter. Much of the subsequent plot development is related by Zucchetti to his wife Sandy.   When waitress Johnson is found dead in her shabby trailer, suspects include her boyfriend, Jake -- surely dealing narcotics from his store -- Helen Harley, a bright high school student whose Goth oufits and acid demeanor bespeak defiance of convention, and deputy Hall Hines, foolishly involved with Johnson despite a cushy life made possible by his wealthy wife.  The suspicious death of rebellious Harley's guardian, Rhu Shaw thickens the bubbling stew.   The husband-wife team of Page Erwin, coastal Maine residents, writes realistic dialogue and intimitely understands police and medical examiner procedures. Their on-site descriptions of weather and locations make us experience the chill, muddy days of an April Maine, in a plot that unravels as surely as the waxing spring sunshine will bring crocuses to bloom.

When I became pregnant I wanted the baby I was carrying to have better alternatives than I did myself as student and far more than my students believed they did, so I started reading a lot about education and finally came across a couple of documentaries on unschooling and became sure that was the path ***I*** wanted to go.   And I was on a mission: convincing my husband that that was the way we should do it. I remember nagging him about it and complaining about his family and being really negative about a lot of stuff.  I must admit I bought Sandra's book because I wanted my husband to read it and I wanted to convince him of my ideas. But before I handed it to him, I started reading it myself.  Sandra writes a lot about how a peaceful home is necessary for unschooling to work. While I read it, I started questioning the way I was dealing with diverging opinions, household duties and almost anything relating to our family life. I realized I was telling my husband that his ideas didn't matter. And I didn't appreciate all the amazing things he does everyday which ensure we have the life we have. I observed our arguments (caused by me!) were also causing instability that stopped learning from happening and was damaging to our daughter. I realized I allowed my fears to lead my decision making. Little by little I became a better partner. It has been a year now: I became a lighter, warmer and more fun to be around person (I like myself better!). I was able to reconnect with my home country culture and to appreciate some aspects of it. I stopped worrying so much. I stopped looking negatively at things I do for my family. I made peace with my mother-in-law and when she came to spend 15 days with us we had amazing conversations and she told me how much she had learned from watching us respectfully care for our daughter and how happy she is to know that her granddaughter is so loved.  I never handed the book to my husband. At some point the book disappeared from my bedside and after a while he told me he was reading it on his commute to work. We actually have so many great conversations on learning.  Unschooling is not about someone telling you how to do things. It is about questioning ourselves and changing the way we do things so learning can flourish (being positive about life helps a lot). So maybe someone who is after a manual on 'how to' will not enjoy reading any of Sandra Dodd's writings (including this book) because she sure won't tell you how something is going to work for your family. I appreciate that. Ready made formulas never worked for me.  And I love we have a book. We are moving somewhere internet connection is far from great so we will have other means to read on unschooling.","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

I didn't expect too much depth - bad guy attracts a good girl and so on -but it seems the author researched about ships and geography which made it enjoyable.

He seemed to be of a genuinely rogue nature even when it came to his feelings which might be a difficult balance (i.e. his scandalous ankle watching, hahaha!!)

Maybe the writer is sick of this universe and was only interested in doing it this way, with four separate voices? I can see how this could be an interesting challenge for a writer. But as a reader I was very disappointed. The characters were not especially like-able, and once you started to maybe like them, bam time for a new character. And the plot/narrative did hold together in a timeline, but I wouldn't say it was an especially tight or cohesive &#34;novel.&#34;<br /><br />I loved the Old Man's War universe and story lines, so I'm happy to get even a little more of it. Thats why this book gets as many stars as it does. If it was about anything else, and written this way, I'd give it even less stars. I have to say this format is great for commuters because it was very easy to put the book down, repeatedly. If I hadn't been sick one day it would have probably taken an extra week to get through. It just didn't really grab me. The stories were too short, and i would have much preferred a novel length outing starring Harry Wilson and Rafe. Everybody seems to agree that was the best story of the bunch, I'm not sure why he didn't/couldnt make that into a full length novel.<br /><br />And the story wasn't quite the end of all things.. It should have been titled &#34;things change.&#34; It really feels like the author just doesnt especially want to write about this anymore. He was under contract to do one more book after this and that will be a couple years later. So while I'm sure this was an ok way for him to keep interested in the subject matter and fulfill his contract it left me really underwhelmed.","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

I didn't know who was Frank Rich and will confess to thinking he was associated with the Bush team in some fashion.<br /><br />A large portion of the information was known by to me through various sources.  The biggest lesson for me was the level of creating alertnate realities and the use of \\""infoganda\\"" by the Bush Administration.  I knew of it but did not know have far it went.  I knew of the fake reporters but I didn't grasp the aspects of creating alternate viewpoints to distract the truth.<br /><br />There are many examples giving alternate realities.  Staging speeches such as after Katrina where generators were set up to give the appearance of power restored to New Orleans which in turn where disabled after the speech.  Ken \\""kenny boy\\"" Lay and Micheael \\""brownie\\"" Brown where it was implied Bush really didn't know them after the fall from grace.<br /><br />What is surprising is the level of character assassination that went on; be it people or the press.  If you can't fight the truth, attack the speaker.  They did it well as it basically caused the Press as Rich calls it to \\""Jump the Shark\\"" during these times.  Hard questions were not asked otherwise, you may appear anti-American, etc.<br /><br />We see this affects discussion today.  Even in the last election, it was suggested to ask hard questions of Sarah Palin would get you labeled as sexist.<br /><br />There is a chronology at the end of the book.  It's interesting to degree depending on your knowledge of things.  Some may argue that it's superficial and in some cases it is but it still offers proof rather then regurgitating the opinions of the practitioners of infotainment.<br /><br />Overall this is not a detailed book.  For example, stuff like the Bush family ties to Middle Eastern Oil is missing.  However, I would not dismiss the book for it would probably take a few books to give a through coverage of this Presidency.<br /><br />In time we will see the effects of this President.  Many avenues of information will be needed and books such as this will be needed give consideration from all angles.of information will be needed and books such as this will be needed give consideration from all angles.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

The book's sections are divided up by country: Bangladesh, Cambodia, China and the Unites States.     Timmerman's writing style is personal, like a deep yet informal conversation with a good friend about the consequences of globalization. It is clear he is passionate about the cause and yet I didn't find him overly preachy about what readers should or should not buy. It was interesting to read about his experiences with the factory workers and what they had to teach. Featuring their pictures throughout the book added a nice touch and helped put a face to a name, which is reminiscent of the greater purpose of Timmerman's journey, to get to know the faces behind the clothing. It is evident that the factory workers, including Arifa, Nari, Ai, Zhu Vhun and Dewan, had a great impact upon Timmerman by the way he conveyed their stories and as a result, I was touched as well.      This book gave me greater insight into the true meaning of `sweatshop' and showed that there is no black and white when deciding which companies to purchase clothing from. I was surprised to learn that the factory workers themselves protest American boycotts and not only want but need us to buy the clothing they make. Often times it is the teenagers and young adults who work so that they can send a large portion of their earnings back to their families in the countryside and they need these jobs to support them. Some of them have even paid just to have the `luxury' of obtaining a factory job, while others use any connections they have to get them. It can be tough to know what the right course of action is when trying to shop in an ethical manner. Timmerman does a good job of outlining the issues and then offers some advice and great websites to help determine which companies deserve our business.      \\""Where Am I Wearing\\"" is an insightful and informative book. I liked that Timmerman included personal anecdotes from his own life and tied in all of his experiences coherently and concisely. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about globalization and factory workers without the feeling of being stuck in a classroom.     [...]","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

John Kaminski's Founders on the Founders is splendidly different.

Not surprisingly, as Kaminski has been rummaging in and publishing their papers for 40+ years.      Noteworthy, too, is the format: Similar in size to Library of America volumes, its readable, portable, and enjoyable. Something to think about in this season of gift-giving.      Finally, in the last few pages in the book Kaminski presents a well-chosen list (all wheat, no chaff) of suggestions for further reading about each of the persons he treats in Founders on the Founders.       -- Jon Kukla, author of Mr. Jefferson's Women (2007)         and A Wilderness So Immense (2003).","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

Whether that is true or not is too large a question to settle here.  We need only say that there is evidence on all sides of it, and he does not present all sides. Instead, he selects the most politically-charged cases, all on the frontiers of constitutional analysis, and hence a misleading sample.     The book is mostly narrative, describing the nominations and confirmations of the last 17 years, and a dozen or so of the Court's most controverial decisions.  Toobin has the TV commentator's skill at rendering the complex clear. You can also see in his writing that faintly arrogant smirk that characterizes his TV commentaries. But it is good and attention-keeping reading.    Toobin himself is a political liberal and a \\""living Constitutionalist\\"". Yet he is reasonably even-handed in his treatment.     The main disappointment is that, despite Toobin's claim of insider access, there is little not previously known.  The most striking insider revelation is in Chief Justice Rehnquist's note to Justice Scalia after Scalia had circulated a disparaging dissent to an O'Connor draft:  \\""Nino, you're pissing off Sandra again.

I love this book set because all the books are available in one box set and they are a bit less expensive than buying them individually (plus the box set looks really good on the bookshelf AND as a gift).    I read each of these books as fast as I could and enjoy having the box set because I know I'll be reading them again and again.  What makes this series so special is that it's cleaner than a lot of adult paranormal romances.  No sex or foul language.

I swear I could not get past the first few hundred pages of the first book.  You would think I might find something of redeeming value in a few hundred pages of writing, but no, nothing at all.  No interesting characters, no compelling plot points, nothing.    On top of being uninspired, the writing is terrible!  The analogies come across as if they are written by a fourth grader, and after removing the unnecessary verbosity, they essentially boil down to drivel such as (I kid you not), \\""The thing smelled as bad as something that smells bad.\\""  The characters are terrible, and there are no redeeming qualities    I honestly could not physically stand the pain of reading the book to completion.  To demonstrate to my girlfriend how bad this series is written, I picked up random books from the series at Borders and flipped to random pages and was easily able to find horrible examples of writing every time without fail.    I suppose the one positive thing about this book is that Terry Goodkind is not the worst published fantasy author in existence.  That title would have to go to Christopher Paolini for writing the tripe known as Eragon.    Oh, and in case you were wondering, I no longer respect the literary opinions of the friend who recommended this series to me.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

The setup is devilishly clever.  Quinn and Nate are doing a cleanup job following the work of an assassin named Ananke.  They discover that the target, one Samuel Edmondson, has a concealed basement/dungeon in which he has imprisoned women for the purposes of human trafficking.  One of the women there, however, is special.  Good and bad people from around the world want to have her detained.  Why?  We don’t know.  She appears to know or possess some secret of great value.<br /><br />Quinn’s sometime director, Helen Cho, may know of the woman’s (Danielle, aka Dani) location.  Helen is abducted and nasty things are done to her in an attempt to extract the information.<br /><br />When multiple groups send ‘hunters’ to find Quinn and Dani, Quinn and Nate must engage in a cross-the-state-of-Washington road trip in which they must dodge hunters in helicopters, cars and, in one case, on a motorcycle.  Since all possess satellite technology and all have computer jock aides running interference for them, the technical details of the chase/evasion are fascinating.  In effect, the book is one long road trip, one long episode of spy vs. spy.  Make that: a trip replete with mysteries.  Who is this Dani person?  What does she know?  Is the information contained somewhere on/in her body?  What is her secret?  Why is it so valuable?  Where is Helen?  What has happened to her?  How can she be found and rescued?<br /><br />As the story develops we are given bits of information.  In effect, the story is one long action/adventure symphony with Battles controlling and synthesizing each of its elements.

This work, originally published in 1902, surveys the first few centuries of Poland's existence as a nation-state. There are chapters on Poland in prehistoric times, the reigns of Mieszko I and Boleslaw the Great, a few interim centuries, and the reign of Casimir the Great.<br /><br />This work describes the Slavic tribes that became Poland. Accounts such as that of Popiel, Wanda, the monster Krak, etc., are deemed to be completely legendary in origin. Of course, an old work like this cannot be up to date. For instance, it fails to elaborate on the Celtic presence in the areas of present-day Poland before the 9th century.<br /><br />Koneczny rejects the premise that the territories between the Odra (Oder) and Wisla (Vistula) had been originally inhabited by Germanic tribes. In fact, he points out that the Romans used the term \\""Germania\\"" in reference to the geographic locality of northwest and north-central Europe, and without any of the modern connotations of ethnicity. (p. 10). Thus, \\""Germania\\"" east of the Laba (Elbe) River, during Roman times and long thereafter, was populated by Slavic tribes.<br /><br />The term \\""Rus\\"" (Ukraine) is believed to be of Scandinavian origin. (p. 44). Koneczny rejects the contentions of Ukrainian nationalists, who argue that the Dniester River had been eternally Ukrainian in population. (p. 35, 40, 45).  He notes that the Dniester River had been a major highway for commerce with Byzantium, and that its upper to central reaches had been settled by Lyakhs (proto-Poles). When the chronicler Nestor around 1100 had described how Vladimir had taken these lands of Przemysl and Czerwien from the Lyakhs, he was referring to the region of the Upper San and Upper Dniester Rivers. Later, Boleslaw the Great regained them for Poland. (p. 83).<br /><br />Konieczny rejects the notion that the annexation of the Ukraine by Casimir the Great had been an imperialistic move. He comments: \\""The action of Casimir the Great was not one of conquest, but one that was the greatest favor to Rus (Ukraine), as it freed them from the Mongolian yoke, and returned them to Europe, thus making them accessible to the forces of civilization.\\"" (p. 354).was not one of conquest, but one that was the greatest favor to Rus (Ukraine), as it freed them from the Mongolian yoke, and returned them to Europe, thus making them accessible to the forces of civilization.\\"" (p. 354).","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

The book contributors (writers Pete Finney, Rosanne Cash, and Michael Streissguth, and artist Jon Langford) lead the reader through the original history of how Nashville became “New Music City” during the late 60’s and early 70’s… a perfect segue to how Nashville continues to forge artistic trails in Music City today.  Nashville presently, as well as in the past, is an all-inclusive hub for music of all genres, from country to folk to rock & roll.  In the pervasive, collaborative spirit of this city, residents come together and connect.  In that fusion of different perspectives, new sounds emerge.<br /><br />Importantly, this book shines a unique light on a group of music artists often neglected in the media – writers and session players.  Many people don’t often think beyond the front-person or recognize that there are numerous others involved in the process of creating and performing music.  These unrecognized artists are relegated to the shadows on the stage and included in the barely visible, fine print on recording albums.  Dylan, Cash, and the Nashville Cats shines a bright spotlight on the multi-faceted artists who have been pivotal in creating, performing, and recording music  - music that has shaped our memories and helped us to design our own, personal life soundtracks. This book brings the essential session players into a well-deserved limelight.<br /><br />Bravo to this wonderful tribute and recognition of these artists.  This is a MUST read book and no one should miss the exhibit at the Country Music Hall of Fame as well.","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

John Hersey, the author, is a fine writer.  I have read one other work of his to date and it was excellent.  Imagine my great anticipation that I discovered and read &#34;Key West Tales&#34;.  I was quite disappointed.  The work is about 225 pages of actual text.  The first story is about 4 pages and is pleasant and mildly humorous.  The next 62 pages is a really dreary story about a person dying of AIDS.  Given that this work was written in 1993 near the height of the AIDS scourge, which did also ravage Key West, maybe that was the point of this work.<br /><br />The next &#34;story&#34; is mostly excerpts from the diary of a local person about John Audubon. I admit the diary entries were enlightening and sobering.  But are these &#34;Tales of Key West&#34;?  This takes us to page 79 of a 225 page work and thus far there has been about 4 pages of true &#34;Tales of Key West&#34;.  As far as I was concerned about one third of this work was &#34;sailing under false colors&#34;...<br /><br />However, the fourth story, &#34;The Two Lives of Consuela Castanon&#34; is more in the keeping of a contemporary American short story and is worthy of the author.  The next story or article is a few pages long and is about an alarm on the island about a possible raid by Native Americans.  I cannot tell if this is an extract from a newspaper, or if Mr. Hersey actually composed this.  It may be an item of local interest, but is not great literature.  The next story is about a group of local authors playing a game of anagrams.  I may have missed the point.  Then there is a brief, amusing story about a steamer eluding a Spanish gunboat using bacon for fuel.  This may be another repeating of a story of local lore.  I can't tell.<br /><br />Then we are back at a strange, but actual short story, &#34;Fantasy Fest&#34;.  It is odd but human and touching, once again worthy of the author.  Next appears a very brief, antebellum antidote about a captured slave ship and its human cargo. It is a poignant story, but again, may not be the work of the author.  This work seems to meander on in this manner, between historical antidotes and actual short stories.  I actually found the stories at the end of the work somewhat more interesting.  There is a short story about Hemingway that I feel is worthy of the author.<br /><br />As I said John Hersey seems to me to be a really fine writer.  In 1946 he wrote an amazing and terrifying account of the bombing of Hiroshima for &#34;The New Yorker&#34;.  It was written from the standpoint of six survivors.  It is almost as lengthy as this work that I am reviewing.  If you only have time for one of the two, read &#34;Hiroshima&#34; and skip this...  Sorry.captured slave ship and its human cargo.

It is clever, exciting and well thought out. On the strength of this, I decided to try Cook's follow-up to \\""Coma\\"", \\""Sphinx\\"", one of the rare occasions in which Cook has moved away from the medical thriller genre. Big mistake. I can't comment on any of Cook's subsequent books, but based on \\""Sphinx\\"", I am starting to think that perhaps \\""Coma\\"" was a fluke. \\""Sphinx\\"" is a slow-moving, utterly boring ordeal. I agree with other reviewers that Cook has done a lot of research in writing this novel, but that is one of the reasons why this novel is so boring. Rather than pack the novel with a series of exciting action scenes, Cook instead forces the reader to follow his protagonist on a tour of Egypt, showing off his knowledge at every stop. It is only in the final 20 or so pages that anything remotely interesting happens (most of the \\""exciting\\"" events described on the back cover of the book happen in this final section), but by that time, all I really cared about was getting the book finished, so I could move on to something more enjoyable. Perhaps Cook's other books are better, but I'm not sure that I want to risk wasting my time and money on another book this boring in order to find out.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

Of course there is not much to spoil.]    It is hard to rate negatively a book with so many praising reviews. I am almost asking myself: am I crazy here? Am I missing something? Perhaps.    You have probably already read the praise (coming of age story, good writing, cool magic system, hints of more to come). I have read it as well. Sure. All of it is very true. Except it doesn't matter. The Name of The Wind is a book about nothing. In fact, save the freaking trees!    Let me elaborate.    1. Cliches.   Gifted boy, dead parents, magical university, it may not seem like much, and I could forgive it all, even for the first. Kvothe is as boring as every Mary Sue genius. I don't give a damn if he becomes a tragic anti hero (in fact I am bloody sure he will, continuing the cliche of a cliche), in this book, there ain't no stopping him.     2. The FUN details  The book is obssessed with money. The climax of the story has Kvothe winning not only a mere price of his broken lute from the offender, but TWICE the amount. I mean, seriously! Still, I can forgive even this.    3. The Nothing  What I cannot forgive is the fact that the book is a diary of the author's self-indulging himself. I could see using Mary Sue for humour. Too bad the book is 100% serious. Too bad the book is 720 pages of fluff with only a single event of any matter happening (in the first 100 pages).    Mr. Rothfuss, save the bloody trees. Hire an editor, cut out 500 pages of fluff, give us a story.   I don't care how many talents Kvothe's tuition is. I don't care how many coppers there are in a silver. I don't care what rate a loan shark is giving these days.   Give me a story.    P.s. Kvothe doesn't burn down the town of Trebon, a dragon (yep, there are dragons too) does. Also, it's not the town but actually like three houses. Noone got hurt though I heard someone broke a leg.

Condon, who made repeated statements before the study ever began, that he did not believe there was anything to UFO reports and that it could all be explained away by modern day scientific explanations, which caused numerous articles to be written denoucning Dr. Condon and the study as being biased from the beginning and not following the inbiased process of the scientific method and not to mention a waste and blunder of the taxpayers money. That study basically ended the US Air Force's UFO project and attempted to explain the photo on the front cover of the book, \\""Incident at Exeter,\\"" as \\""an out-of-focus plate-like object supported by a human arm and hand photgraphed by time-exposure\\"" and Dr. Condon further stated that the photo and multiple witnesses were \\""of no probative value.\\"" However, the University of Colorado's commissioned study group produced an, at best, flimsy and obviously fabricated duplication of the photograph, using their estimated theory of an \\""out-of-focus plate-like object supported by a human arm and hand photgraphed by time-exposure,\\"" while they could not duplicate the other photograph, discussed in the book, \\""Incident at Exexter,\\"" but not on the cover and taken during the same UFO sighting, as that one had no evidence of what the UFO group NICAP, concluded as being an invisible gaseous discharge from the UFO and Dr. Condon concluded was a human arm. So, the University of Colorado could not even produce a fabricated duplication of both UFO photographs, but still conluded that both photos were hoaxes. I would liken a comparison of the actual authentic UFO photographs from the multiple witness UFO sighting discussed in the book, \\""Incident at Exeter,\\"" and the fabricated photographs created for Case Number 53, in the University of Colorado, \\""Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects,\\"" report, as comparing a photo of a real Navy fighter jet flying in the sky to a photo of a small scale model of a Navy fighter jet held on a string, which even a child can tell the difference of which photograph is authentic and which photograph is not. You can purchase the \\""Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects,\\"" by the University of Colorado and Dr. Edward U. Condon, for very cheap as a paperback from Amazon.com, along with the book by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, former US Air Force, UFO Projects Sign, Grudge and Blue Book civilian scientific consultant, entitled, \\""The UFO Experience: A Scientific Inquiry,\\"" in order to compare the two, just as I have suggested with the Navy fighter jet photo comparison to the \\""Incident at Exeter,\\"" and University of Colorado UFO photographs, with the second book, Dr. Hynek's, \\""The UFO Experience: A Scientific Inquiry,\\"" being the genuine and authentic scientific analysis and study of the UFO pehnomenon, while the \\""Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects,\\"" by the University of Colorado and Dr. Edward U. Condon, disobeys the scientific method and creates explanations where there seemingly exist no modern-day scientific explanations, even today, for the UFOs that have been described and photographed. Dr. J. Allen Hynek's, \\""The UFO Experience: A Scientific Inquiry,\\"" is hands down, one of the best UFO books ever written, along with the book, \\""Incident at Exeter,\\"" by John G. Fuller, being right there with it. Also, another classic UFO analysis book is the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, NICAP, book \\""The UFO Evidence,\\"" originally published in 1964 and reprinted by Barnes and Noble in 1997, which is usually a fairly cheap softcover book found on Amazon.com, with sometimes fairly cheap original 1964 editions found on Amazon.com and other internet websites. So, this is all encompassing of the book, \\""Incident at Exeter,\\"" by John G. Fuller, as all of these books are inter-related. Best wishes on finding your own level of satisfaction of documented truth about UFOs in the book \\""Incident at Exeter,\\"" by John G. Fuller and with the others which I have recommended that make a great companion to it. Thank you for reading.    C. Pack  Virginia Beach, VA USA","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

It provided a deep plot line that was concluded in a very tasteful way.  The \\""who done it\\"" aspect of the book combined with the non-stop action provided a novel that was impossible to put down.  It also broke down the character of Mitch Rapp more so then the previous novels.  It really gave you incite into who Mitch Rapp really is and how complex he is.      The only downside to the book, which in my opinion is a plus, is that it must be indulged following the completion of the previous book, The Third Option.  Separation of Power picks up were the Third Option leaves off, creating high intensity series that takes you for politically charged, action packed roller coaster ride that keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time.  If you do not read the Third Option prior to Separation of Power, you lose a lot of the back story, along with, in my opinion, the entire experience.  It would be like ready the Return of the King, by J.R. Tolkein and not reading the two proceeding books.  It just does not make sense.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

Of course there is not much to spoil.]    It is hard to rate negatively a book with so many praising reviews. I am almost asking myself: am I crazy here? Am I missing something? Perhaps.    You have probably already read the praise (coming of age story, good writing, cool magic system, hints of more to come). I have read it as well. Sure. All of it is very true. Except it doesn't matter. The Name of The Wind is a book about nothing. In fact, save the freaking trees!    Let me elaborate.    1. Cliches.   Gifted boy, dead parents, magical university, it may not seem like much, and I could forgive it all, even for the first. Kvothe is as boring as every Mary Sue genius. I don't give a damn if he becomes a tragic anti hero (in fact I am bloody sure he will, continuing the cliche of a cliche), in this book, there ain't no stopping him.     2. The FUN details  The book is obssessed with money. The climax of the story has Kvothe winning not only a mere price of his broken lute from the offender, but TWICE the amount. I mean, seriously! Still, I can forgive even this.    3. The Nothing  What I cannot forgive is the fact that the book is a diary of the author's self-indulging himself. I could see using Mary Sue for humour. Too bad the book is 100% serious. Too bad the book is 720 pages of fluff with only a single event of any matter happening (in the first 100 pages).    Mr. Rothfuss, save the bloody trees. Hire an editor, cut out 500 pages of fluff, give us a story.   I don't care how many talents Kvothe's tuition is. I don't care how many coppers there are in a silver. I don't care what rate a loan shark is giving these days.   Give me a story.    P.s. Kvothe doesn't burn down the town of Trebon, a dragon (yep, there are dragons too) does. Also, it's not the town but actually like three houses. Noone got hurt though I heard someone broke a leg.   Hope this gives you a hint that bait-and-switch is about the most this book can offer.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

I'll stick to three things in particular: storytelling patience, storytelling skill, and storytelling philosophy.<br /><br />Storytelling Patience - One of the most impressive things about Peterson's debut effort is that he has patience in his storytelling. He lets dramatic tension build appropriately, doesn't give things away too easy, and keeps you wondering what's coming. Even where upcoming plot points can be deduced in advance, Peterson unfolds them with skill and delight. The story moves along at a nice pace, with new and intriguing aspects of the world of Aerwiar being unveiled; it picks up its pace at the appropriate place, and by the time the story is rolling toward its climax, we are thoroughly immersed in this secondary world Peterson has created. Not only that, but he pulled off a really important balance: he told a full enough story to stand alone, but left enough unanswered to leave you longing for the next installment of the Wingfeather Saga.<br /><br />Storytelling Skill - Peterson creates an entirely believable, quirky secondary world with lots of humor, but not so much that the story isn't taken seriously. There are great names, both for humans (Janner, Tink, and Leeli Igiby, Nugget the dog, Peet the Sock Man, Podo, Oskar N. Reteep), for bad guys (Khrak, Gnorm, Slarb, Vop, Gnag the Nameless), and for creatures (Fangs of Dang, toothy cows, horned hounds, thwaps). The characters are compelling, and I found myself particularly drawn to Podo and Peet the Sock Man.<br /><br />Storytelling Philosophy - Peterson clearly believes that our own subcreations echo the Maker's primary creation. Apart from references to prayers, there is no explicit religious content to the story; yet the story makes the heart yearn for the remembrance of the true victory of Christ over evil, which is exactly what a fairy tale can do. Peterson's story fits all the requirements of the fairy tale laid out by great thinkers like George MacDonald, G.K. Chesteron, J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, and Madeleine L'Engle. On the Edge of the Dark Sea of Darkness clearly stands in their noble tradition.<br /><br />I highly recommend Andrew Peterson's On the Edge of the Dark Sea of Darkness.laid out by great thinkers like George MacDonald, G.K.

Why do so many people who write books have to take 200 pages to say what could be condensed into 30? Thats what I get from this book. I need to waft thru over 175 pages before hearing I should join my local chamber of commerce and kawannis clubs and anywhere I can get exposure? This book while seeming to have some good tips, appears to need to be condensed into a booklet, not a book. Also from the little I read, this is just stuff from the last 5 books I read rehashed. I am an avid reader of quantum physics and meditation as well, yet I find this book very difficult to stay interested in. When you have to keep reading every page twice, thats a bad sign. Smart author. Too long of a book. I admit it, the well thought out title of the book hooked me. Otherwise.....zzzzzzzzz.      Addendum: I notice every single person here gives this book 5 stars. I suggest when you see that you check to see if they have reviewed any other books or maybe are just buddies of the author. I ask any person who has given a review that is over 6 months old to tell us exactly how this book helped them in real life. Maybe its just me.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

She has a challenging concept that she pulls off very well.<br /><br />Doctor Olaf Van Schuler's Brain begins with the story of a doctor practicing radical medicine in the 17th century, and then each chapter moves forward in time and along the family tree, as his descendants follow his profession and also participate in cutting edge medicine of their time period.<br /><br />Part of the fun - and yes, though this is certainly literary fiction it is an enjoyable read as well - is figuring out just who the chapter will focus on as  you begin each one. Sometimes a patient is the focus, although always one of the lineage of Van Schuler is a central character to the story.<br /><br />The last couple chapters switch from third person POV to first, and that was a little disconcerting but the nature of those particular chapters were well suited to that change.<br /><br />All in all, one of the more interesting approaches to a novel that I have read this year, and certainly worth the time to read.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

Yet thousands of men and woman willingly walk into caves and mines every day. Many never see the light of day again. As soon as I saw Hector Tobar's Deep Down Dark: The Untold Stories of 33 Men Buried in a Chilean Mine, and the Miracle That Set Them Free it went on my to read list.<br /><br />One sentence summary:<br /><br />Thirty-three men survive sixty-nine days under two thousand three hundred feet beneath the surface by a combination of occupational pride and faith.<br /><br />Kudos:<br /><br />First of all, the story alone of how these thirty-three men survived for so long underground is unparalleled. With a subject matter so interesting, it's hard to go too wrong. Tobar's account puts the readers right next to the miners as they struggle starvation, sensory deprivation and some how find a way to survive until they are rescued. I have mixed feelings about the way the story was told, but the very personal narration kept me turning the page to see how these men with vastly different personalities, fears, passions and flaws would be able to stay sane until they could finally be set free. The aftermath stories about how the men dealt with - or failed to deal with - this life changing experience were just as compelling as the rescue.<br /><br />Quibbles:<br /><br />While the personal style of narration brings the reader into the mine, sometimes I felt like it was too much information. There was a lot of detail that either had to be obtained from the journals some of the men kept or interviews. At times the drama and conflicts felt a little exaggerated, but I have not read any other accounts. So it is hard for me to judge how true to life the account was. I'm not sure if it was an attempt to be true to the men and their survival story or if the author took creative liberties.<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />An interesting read to be sure, but Deep Down Dark... like the title feels a little too long. I just hope that this is an account the men involved signed off on and is true to their experience.","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

It's a real treasure in World War II writing. I was going through some old boxes and discovered this among my late father-in-law's Louie L'Amour and Zane Grey books. Dick used to enjoy westerns, but being a WW II veteran, I believe he must have had some inside information on this book and added it to his collection.<br /><br />During WW II there was a high percentage of young men that enlisted or were drafted into the armed forces. These were men from all walks of life, all regions of the country, all education levels, and all professions. It's not surprising that many of them were journalists or writers. Several of them became award winning authors. One such writer/B-17 co-pilot was Bert Stiles. Stiles wrote this brilliant book about his experiences and feelings. He wrote before going to England, while off-duty in England, and he wrote between his bombing missions. Unfortunately, Stiles didn't survive the war, but his mother copyrighted his memoirs, letters, and journals in 1947, and she published them in this book in 1952.<br /><br />Serenade to the Big Bird is brilliant, captivating, almost haunting writing with artistic scene and character development. Had Stiles survived the war, I'm confident that his name would be a household word and synonym for excellence. This is one of those books that you can't put down - a remarkable literary achievement. Serenade is written in a matter-of-fact, casual, slang-infused manner, as if Stiles was simply talking to himself and reflecting his own personal thoughts. After all, that's what it was... somewhat like a diary, and it's a precious one at that. Stiles wanders down many roads including education, politics, dating (dames), friendships, the horror of war... he spends a good deal of time questioning the bombing and feeling guilty about it.<br /><br />Born in Denver, Colorado, August 30, 1920, Stiles entered Colorado College in 1938. He majored in journalism and wrote many anti-war articles for The Tiger, the college newspaper. He went on to write articles accepted by Saturday Evening Post, Liberty, and American magazines. While in England, he wrote articles for the London Daily Mail, and for the Army Air Corps. The author was a co-pilot on a B-17 bomber and flew 35 dangerous missions. Stiles always wanted to fly fighter planes, and he eventually became a pilot of a P-15 and escorted bombers over Germany. But on November 26, 1944 he was shot down over Hanover. Stiles was posthumously awarded the Air Medal, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the Purple Heart.

Very well written, the reader has no problem diving right into the book and reading through the whole thing in a matter of days because you actually want to read it, and not just to get through it. There was never a dull moment, never a chapter I felt was unnecessary, and each moment I was trying to anticipate what might come next.    Other reviewers have said the villains are too \\""over the top\\"" and \\""one dimensional.\\"" While I agree that the villains were 100% bad guy, I never felt like they were necessarily \\""too evil.\\"" They didn't have too much depth to them, but they didn't need it and it was clear that we weren't supposed to sympathize with them whatsoever. Unfortunately, where the book is lacking is that I didn't sympathize with the victims much either.    While the book was very well written, there was very little that ever really described anything. I never really felt like the author painted a clear picture in my mind of the setting, the characters, or even the horrible events that were transpiring. My imagination is fairly active and I'm an anatomy teacher, so I was able to fill in the blanks myself for most things in this book, but I imagine that for the average person this book would be fairly boring. Additionally, I felt that the characters we were supposed to sympathize with were far too one-dimensional and lacking much emotion. I never felt what the characters were feeling. I think that's where this book is left wanting.    Overall, a good read, very enjoyable, but hardly terrifying. You won't be getting nightmares from this horror novel, but you will get a few good days out of it. I'd recommend it for people with active imaginations.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

One thing many forget and or deny is that we have a freedom in Christ that many other religions do not enjoy. Outright sin and evil are never to be part of a church service, or of private Christian life, but being innovative and using some things in modern society to reach out to the lost is not necessarily a sin. For instance, if a church wants to reach out to rebellious, rocker youth, it may be prudent to put some hymns to rock music, and spice up the service to show the kids that it is possible to be a Christian, and still have fun. I personally do not know of any church that practices communism, but that is exactly what believers did in the early church, at least for a while. The term \\""New Testament church\\"" is highly subject to personal interpretation. Some so called New Testament churches \\""practice\\"" speaking in tongues, but in reality, they probably are not doing what was done in the first century. I do not honestly believe that God wants us to pattern modern churches after the New Testament church, in any regard but strong doctrine. The early church didn't have tools like DVD players, cars and airplanes, and as such had to do things differently. Yes we worship on Sunday, but the word Sabbath simply means seventh, so any one day out of seven is valid to worship on. Some get dressed up for church, while others go in jeans, it matters not. The author is definitely biased and is tying to impart his particular sectarian beliefs on the rest of us, and while he has the right to try, you have the right to say no. I go to church, I sing hymns, I worship God and fellowship with other believers and I take of the cup and the bread. I also study the word of God with other believers, something that the early church didn't always do, simply because at that time, the New Testament was not yet finished. So, am I pagan for that?

Wasn't she concerned about the safety of herself and her unborn child knowing what Paul was capable of?  Her only concern was how to cover up his crime???<br /><br />It should have been royally troubling to her to realize what violence her husband possessed, yet somehow it sailed over her head.  There are extreme situations where violence gets repaid with violence, but that was not what was depicted here.<br /><br />Worse yet, Lauren kept claiming that Paul had viciously beaten Scott \\""for her\\"".  Lauren had engaged in a consensual act with Scott.  Paul was not protecting Lauren by any stretch of the imagination, so how could she keep justifying his behavior?  How could his violent propensity not be totally troubling to her?<br /><br />Women with low self-esteem are notorious for making all kinds of excuses for men.  It is a waving red flag when women read \\""noble\\"" motivations into negative and disturbing behavior on the part of men, both for their own sake and for the sake of their children.<br /><br />I believe that Paul had a chip missing in that he could behave so violently and viciously toward others.  Lauren had her own chip missing in terms of not only failing to see the problem but, worse yet, to interpret it as somehow being a tribute to her relationship with him.<br /><br />Is our society becoming so desensitized to the violence depicted by the media that this constituted a reasonable response to a vicious beating?  And have male-female relationships become so troubled that Lauren did not run for her life and the life of her unborn child before Paul erupted again?<br /><br />I could go on and on, but I would like to point out one other thing.  This novel depicted caffeine and alcohol as being plausible beverage choices for a pregnant woman.  I am willing to cut Patterson some slack on this on account of his being a man.  Yet I certainly hope his female readers are savvy enough to realize the hazards these substances can present to an unborn child.<br /><br />Let's please not buy everything the media sells us as being acceptable or advisable.illing to cut Patterson some slack on this on account of his being a man.

The car crash that claims Lisa Kim's life happens right in front of the story's main character, Pete Ferry, a school teacher and frequent contributor to The Chicago Tribune's Travel section, however, the details around that crash are not exactly clear cut.<br /><br />Ferry discovers more about Lisa Kim after a moment of mistaken identity and quickly becomes pulled into the circumstances that surrounded her death.  Here, something is not right, the pieces of the puzzle won't line up, and before long, Ferry's own life is being derailed as he tries to understand the mystery.<br /><br />As odd as it may seem, a writer placing a version of himself in his own works is not such a stretch for those of us who have read books like City of Glass, or even seen the movie Adaptation; however, the skill that Ferry uses to confuse and blur the lines that link fact and reality is handled so well that several sections call into question the very nature of story and fiction.<br /><br />And while there are several interludes that section off the main narrative in the forms of classroom discussions and travel logs, these breaks are often as engaging as the main narrative.<br /><br />While the plot of the story does well to keep the reader turning the pages, the themes of Travel Writing are what make the book really shine.  Covering everything from connection, loss and obsession to love, desire and infatuation, the novel travels as much as the main character, presenting the reader with an overall goal of learning how the book's asides all tie together.<br /><br />As Ferry learns more about the world and more about himself through his travels and his interactions, he shows us both the terrible aspects of the world along with the good.<br /><br />In addition to these thoughts on the world at large, Ferry also contemplates issues closer to home, such as relationships, want and jealousy, each topic changing his perception and overall outlook on life.<br /><br />From the book:  \\""I had made a decision to live every day not as if it were my last day, but as if it were my only day; not so that I would remember it in a year or even a month, but so that at the end of it when I lay down at night, I could say that I had not wasted it, not sleepwalked through it, that I had lived it.\\""<br /><br />What this story is primarily concerned with is the change that happens in a person who witnesses some terrible thing that they'll never be able to forget.

When I finally decided to read it, however, I was delightfully surprised by the engaging and well-written storyline.  This book traces about thirty years of history in Afghanistan, first through the eyes of Mariam, a girl wed to a man thirty years her senior.  Mariam was born a harami, a bastard daughter born out of wedlock to a household servant and hidden away to conceal the father's shame.  When her mother dies, Mariam's father, to escape the wrath of his wives (he has three) forces her to marry a shoemaker named Rasheed and move to a different city.  Mariam, who was born to a poor life to begin with, can only watch as her life deteriorates further when she is unable to produce any children for her husband.  Ten years later, we pick up the story again through the eyes of Laila, a young girl born to a neighbor of Mariam's.  The ongoing wars kill Laila's parents when she is just fourteen, and she is taken in by Rasheed, who is struck by her beauty and has plans of taking her as a second wife.  When Laila discovers that she's pregnant by a childhood sweetheart who has also been killed by the war, she assents to be Rasheed's wife, not knowing what she is getting herself into.<br /><br />This book continues through the eyes of Mariam and Laila, as they form an unlikely friendship and care for each other and eventually Laila's children and try to protect each other from their abusive husband.  The situation in Afghanistan continues to deteriorate for women, and watching as life gets harder and harder for these spirited two was deeply moving to me.  The language is rich, the characters fleshed-out, the dialogue realistic, and the story heartbreaking and uplifting all at once.  I love a book that draws me in so deeply that I have to actively clear it from my head in between reading sessions, and this one had just that effect on me.  Reading this book had me smelling the spices they cooked with, feeling the burden of wearing a burqa, and hearing the constant explosions of a seemingly never-ending war.  The ending was ultimately bittersweet for me.  This book will make you think deeply about the cultural differences that still exist in the world to this day; it certainly gave me a better understanding of Afghanistan, and that's something I feel a lot of people could benefit from.ey cooked with, feeling the burden of wearing a burqa, and hearing the constant explosions of a seemingly never-ending war.

Finally, someone understands what it is all about.     It is really very simple.  God created us to share his universe and to share in love and brotherhood. If God ever made a mistake, it was giving man freedom of choice. God is love and all he wants for us is to love and be loved. That's it!!  Why does man insist on creating problems and complicating simple issues?  Man has to twist it, confuse it, discuss it, contemplate it, study it, write complicated memorandums on it and put rules to it. God did not create religion. Religion and Church were created by man to have control over people in God's name. You can have church in your heart. If people would stop blaming, critizing, hating, and seeing nothing but themselves, perhaps they could then see what God wants for them. We are to blame for the condition of the world. Our thoughts, our actions, our non-actions, everything we do has a reaction in the Universe.  If you want a true relationship with God/Jesus, all you have to do is ask. This book, in my opinion, is right on target!! I am sure the theology students will all have their deep thoughts on the subject, however, there is no deep dark secret or hidden agenda behind what God wants for us.  Why does everyone insist there is?  Read this book, it will give you a whole new perspective on life and God, it will change you and make you a better person.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

While I don't necessarily agree with every single thing he wrote in the book, I still learned a lot from reading it and will absolutely take the lessons from this book with me into my future endeavors.  In fact, I couldn't put the book down and read the whole thing in a couple of days.  While Salatin talks specifically about farming (because he is, in fact, a farmer), the principles and values discussed in the book can easily be applied to any cottage industry or family business.  If you have a dream to create some sort of family business and pass that along to your children and grandchildren, then you absolutely need to read this book.","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

The character with the more compelling story, Snow Flower should have been the narrator. I did not like Lily; her clinging to convention and the canned advice / accepted words strikes me as odd for someone who came from a lower class, and who would not have been exposed to the conventions of a \\""Lady\\"" of the era. I also find it hard to believe that tiny lotus feet would allow a woman of no means to marry up. None of the relationships felt real, not even the one between Lily and Snow Flower.    The only interesting parts of this book are the process of foot binding, the Nu Shu language, the different relationships between women (sworn sisters v. lao tungs) and perhaps the typhoid epidemic.

Dr. Taylor describes the occurrence of her stroke and the immediate days and weeks that followed, written with the clarity and precision of a trained neuroanatomist.  Dr. Taylor suffered (temporary) loss of the functions of the dominant logical left brain, and discovered the capabilities of the (normally) subordinate right brain.  Later chapters describe some of her long-term learnings regarding trusting and relying on the capabilities of her right-brain.  The reader has to trust what she writes, something of a \\""leap of faith\\"", but that really is to be expected when using the logical left-brain's tool of language to describe the contextual perceptual processing of the right brain.

When I buy a product that has clever packaging, little gems in every nook and cranny, it makes me love the product more - putting in that extra effort, to me, says you care about your product. So when I got my copy of Boomtown I was immediately impressed by the little details. The author's pseudonym reminded me of Lemony Snicket. The concept of a warm and caring Utopian society who just happen to be obsessed with blowing things up - it all sounded terrific. I couldn't wait to devour it.<br /><br />Boomtown is the story of reverend Arthur Button, who moves his family to Boomtown after accepting a job with Boomtown Church. His wife and three children are all funny and clever - the kids are always getting into trouble but escaping unscathed. These four do very well in Boomtown and hearing the story from any of their perspectives might have been a treat. But this story is told from the point of view of Arthur, who is the most boring stick in the mud you will ever meet.<br /><br />I think most people would love to live in Boomtown. But Arthur Button does not. And since we are reading from his perspective, the whole thing feels boring and stuffy. Button almost dies 6 times in this story and I don't think I cared once.<br /><br />What disappoints me the most was the sheer amount of potential this book had - if it hadn't been narrated by Arthur, it might have been great. Why was this a children's book? I can't imagine any kid who would want to read a story told from the perspective of their father. Most kids would rather read a story from another kid's perspective.<br /><br />Supposedly there will be a second book - I won't be reading it. But hopefully my negative review will yield a positive result for Nowen N. Particular - you had a good idea, you just mucked it up royally. Next time, try writing from the perspective of someone we can care about.<br /><br />*Disclaimer* : I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

A quarter century of the most shockingly famous photographs by Helmut Newton, David Bailey, Bruce Weber, and other tastemakers are contextualized by well-known essayists, a chorus of celebrity contributions, and Iman's own take on her much mythologizied career. The book's outrageous pop design by legendary graphic designer Jonathan Barnbrook makes it plain that this is not just one woman's success story; Iman captures the funny, infuriating, and often absurd validation of black and ethnic looks in a beauty industry where billions of dollars, and the self-image of women everywhere are on the line. Peeks behind the curtain and scintillating interviews are courtesy of feminist critic bell hooks, Interview editor Ingrid Sischy, model and manager Bethann Hardison, and others. With graphic design featuring pop-ups and other interactive elements, as well specially commissioned, never-before-seen images by Annie Leibowitz, Ellen Von Unwerth, Sante D'Orazio and Michel Comte, this book is an assemblage worthy of any fashionista's dream.","2008-12-16","2008","Books"

SPOILERS!!    For those of you who have read Shadow Kiss, I knew there was a strong possibility that this ending could happen while reading the book, it seemed too dangerous to not lose one of the main characters in Rose's life.  However, that did not soften the blow when it actually happened.  I do have to give Mead major props for making Dimitri a Strigoi rather than killing him and thus all hope I might have had for the next book.  Still, it has never been mentioned if there is any other way for a Strigoi to go back to the way he way was.  I mean just to know if there was or wasn't a possibility would be a big help...does anyone remember her writing about this?  Also, I have to say, I know that it would be extremely hard for Lissa to have brought him back from the dead but I couldn't believe that she wouldn't do that for Rose who had more of less given most of her life up for Lissa's.  Granted she is \\""supposed to\\"" but it seems odd that Lissa would save a bird and a dove but not be willing to save Dimitri.  I got false hope during that moment thinking she would bring him back...of course that was dashed again whne I finished.

I've encouraged my son (11) to read the books as vampires and werewolves are right up his alley and so far he is finishing Eclipse and rounding third to New Moon.  Then I started reading Breaking Dawn...what the heck happened?!  First, the fourth book is NOTHING like the first three.  It is almost as if she was writing a totally different story.  The names are the same but they are not the same people.  What made the characters interesting is non-existent in this book.  This story is not romantic and it doesn't have that \\""pull\\"" that the first three books had.  Second, I saw an interview with the author where they make a point that the characters did not have sex - well, that changes soon in the fourth book.  I am no shrew, but there were times where I was even shocked and amazed at what was going on.  Bruises?!  Breaking headboards?!  Pregnancy?!  WTF?!  At this point I am trying to come up with a way to tell my son that after reading the first three books he won't be able to read the fourth book until he is 18.  I am warning all of my friends not to let their kids read this book.  Not only does it not seem to fit in with the theme and undertone of the series - which is the Romeo & Juliette-esque theme of forbidden love - but it was completely irresponsible of the author, knowing her fan base is mostly comprised of teenage girls, to wrap up teenage sex, marriage and motherhood in this bright shiny red candy-like wrapper and serve it up to inocent little minds like it was a lollipop.  Even Bella being turned into a vampire was nothing - none of the terrible things that happened to the other vampires when they \\""changed\\"" happened to her.  The author might as well have stuck a crack pipe in her mouth and showed that smoking crack doesn't really hurt you, either!  This book upset me on so many levels.

From what I have read on the man's early life it is clear that he suffered immensely both from abusive parents, step parents and from psychiatric illness. He rose above it all though and created some stunning literature. His style of simplicity and vivid, even psychedelic imagery employing an avant guarde inimitable style of writing, struck me as fresh and breezy.<br /><br />Dreaming of Babylon was fun to read and had that mike hammer pulp noirish feel to it.<br /><br />I found a confederate general from big sur almost bordering on some sort of an autobiograhical account of Richard's life. It was highly enjoyable.<br /><br />On the other hand the hawkline monster was childish drivel and the ending where each of the characters landed up in society made a mockery out of the whole piece.<br /><br />It was a shame that Richard took his own life. One of his editors(publishers?) said that his writing never matured. He probably never wanted to grow up but his audience moved on and he was left alone. Sad really.<br /><br />Go out and read his stuff. You'd be missing out on his greatness if you didn't.","2008-12-17","2008","Books"

I am so tired of reading every book, seeing every documentary and hearing every news broadcast that is totally biased towards the Jew's struggle during WWII.<br />YOU really need to search out books such as this one to gain an understanding of Hitler's objectives for the Germans. YOU need to understand that most everything you have heard is fabricated and far from the truth. The best advice I can give you is to read some books!!! Do a little analytical thinking for yourself rather than drawing on what we are fed. Read Mein Kampf. Read Look to Germany. Read this book and others.<br />Hiter was not a monster. Hitler was not a homosexual. Hitler did not have only 'one nut'(and who cares if he did). These are just some of the lies used to discredit Hitler's character. Before you pass on incorrect information (lies) onto others learn the truth. Learn what the Nazis really stood for. They wanted so much good for the German people I can't begin to go into it all here. Find out for yourself. READ! But be careful what you are reading is of a neutral, unbiased opinion. This sounds easier than it really is. So much information out there is just made up by Jewish authors and film producers. I don't want to sound finatical so learn for yourself how our society is controlled by the Jews.<br />Learn what the Nazi's objectives were. Please don't confuse the Nazis with Neo-Nazis or Skinheads. These latter groups are just a bunch of confused lunatics who happen to use the swastica for their propaganda. Search out traditional Nazism.<br />Read about the Nazis. Read about the Rothschilds. It will open your eyes!","2008-12-17","2008","Books"

I listened to this book on Audible—my first experience with an audiobook.  I was impressed with the high quality and the excellent narration.   This is a wonderful story, weaving together the lives of three families and three adults specifically.  Each is dealing with family problems and challenges.  One woman had spent her life, trying to stay out of her famous family’s limelight—to finally realize through the help of two other train travelers, that family is important, no matter how difficult the situation may be.  Another woman had run away from her family situation; she could not deal any longer with her daughter’s emotional problems and abuse directed at her.  It became so bad that she had to escape to save herself.  Through the course of her train trip, with the friendship of the other travelers and a divine encounter, she finds courage to face a life-threatening situation.  The final passenger of the three is dealing with the loss of his wife—the one who cared for his two young children and without whom he did not know how to cope or interact with his kids.  The two women travelers in a few short days teach him how to connect to his children and to be the father that his kids need.  Their encounter on the train changes all of their lives for the good and forms lasting relationships.  A very enjoyable story, excellently crafted and narrated.  It is uplifting and gives life lessons on relationships and how necessary people are to each other.  I would recommend this book.  I received this book through TBCN in exchange for an honest review.","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

One thing that you notice right off the bat is that Americans haven't really changed since Twain's time.  We still make the same remarks and complain about the same things and are prone to the same bad habits as then.      The funniest parts of this book is when Twain is talking about the paintings of the old masters or about the relics of Europe's churches.  Twain likes to give his honest opinion in saying that he enjoys newer painting more than the old faded and cracked paintings of the old masters, and he is sure to torture any tour guide that gets within his grip with the fact.  As for the relics, Twain notes that there are enough pieces of the true cross to make several copies over.  The skeptic in Twain comes out and he points out everything that he thinks is false or a sham.    The reason that I say this isn't Twain's best is that this was written by a young Twain as a newspaper writer, so in a sense he he writing to appeal to a larger crowd.  He takes every opportunity to criticize the people and races that he encounters on his travels.  To the modern reader, some of this criticism will read like racial stereotyping, so at times it may be uncomfortable for the modern reader to read.  The more tolerant Twain that we often hear quoted doesn't develop until later in his career.","2008-12-17","2008","Books"

However, in the course of treating a young patient named Catherine, who presented with symptoms of severe phobias that did not respond to conventional treatment, the doctor stumbled upon past-life regression, which cured the patient of her symptoms. This book is the narrative of how that happened. The story is engaging and free of the psychological jargon and scholarly references that would have precluded the book's great popular success.    Reincarnation is something for which there is much evidence and about which (as the author notes) much has been written, yet many people refuse to consider that evidence. The author himself was skeptical at first of his own experiences with Catherine, yet her ability to tell him specific things about his deceased father and deceased young son, things that she could not have known (in any ordinary way), helped persuade him to keep an open mind and eventually to risk professional ridicule by coming forth with this account, which is an argument in favor of the reality of reincarnation and the therapeutic efficacy of past-life regression.    The book is a condensed account of the many past lives to which Catherine regressed in her sessions with Dr. Weiss, as well as the periods between lives, in which she was in contact with Masters, who sometimes spoke through her. Catherine, like the doctor, was not predisposed to believe in reincarnation. She had been brought up in the Catholic faith and at first was not comfortable with the idea of reincarnation. In her various past lifetimes, she had incarnated as both male and female. Many of the people with whom she was most closely associated in past lives were people with whom she was connected in her present life (she \\""knew\\"" them), but many were not. (\\""I do not know him [in thislifetime].\\"")    Perhaps the most important take-away idea from this book is that physical, emotional, and psychological issues that affect people today could stem not from a childhood trauma of the current lifetime (a staple of Freudian psychoanalysis), but from a traumatic event or a habitual pattern of a abuse or hardship in a past life or in past lives. The healing from these lingering difficulties seems to stem from bringing these past-life experiences into awareness so that they can be acknowledged and released.","2008-12-17","2008","Books"

For those of you who have read Shadow Kiss, I knew there was a strong possibility that this ending could happen while reading the book, it seemed too dangerous to not lose one of the main characters in Rose's life.  However, that did not soften the blow when it actually happened.  I do have to give Mead major props for making Dimitri a Strigoi rather than killing him and thus all hope I might have had for the next book.  Still, it has never been mentioned if there is any other way for a Strigoi to go back to the way he way was.  I mean just to know if there was or wasn't a possibility would be a big help...does anyone remember her writing about this?  Also, I have to say, I know that it would be extremely hard for Lissa to have brought him back from the dead but I couldn't believe that she wouldn't do that for Rose who had more of less given most of her life up for Lissa's.  Granted she is \\""supposed to\\"" but it seems odd that Lissa would save a bird and a dove but not be willing to save Dimitri.  I got false hope during that moment thinking she would bring him back...of course that was dashed again whne I finished.

As with this other works of fiction it is set in the Wessex region of England (essentially the southwestern part of the country) and relates to the efforts of ordinary people to find happiness in love and life.  The book centers around three characters. Elfride Swancourt is a young (18) girl who lives with her vicar father in Endelson Vicarage in Lower Wessex. Stephen Smith is a young (21) architect who comes to the vicarage to make some drawings preparatory to his firm doing some architectural work.  As we might expect he and Elfride fall in love but their marriage is opposed by the vicar because of Stephen's low social standing--his parents live in the area and his father is a mason.  The couple pledge their love for each other and after an abortive elopement attempt Stephen goes off to India to seek his fortune.<br /><br />The widowed, socially ambitious vicar marries a much older (and richer) woman and together they aspire for Elfride to marry into a higher social status.  At this point a relative of the new Mrs. Swancourt, Henry Knight, comes to visit. Knight is older (32) and more sophisticated, working as a lawyer and literary reviewer. He is also the mentor of Stephen who has told Efride of his admiration for the older man.  Efride soon comes to be attracted to Knight, who is naïve in love affairs but comes to return her love. Events lead to the inevitable tragic climax in Hardy's novels when Stephen returns from India hoping to gain the hand of Elfride.<br /><br />In my view Elfride is not a tragic heroine because she brings about her downfall by her own acts. A true tragic hero or heroine suffers because of the acts of others or because of circumstances beyond his or her control.  In Jude the Obscure, for example, what happens to Jude is not of his doing and thus what happens to him is truly tragic.  But Elfride is unfaithful, deceitful and immature and it is these attributes that lead to her final consequences.<br /><br />One of the joys of reading Hardy is his portrayal of ordinary people in Wessex. For example, when Stephen returns from India his parents have a pig killed and plan a party for him. The professional pig killer comes to the Smith household, as do another couple, William Worm, a jack of all trades who hears a constant buzzing in his head and his new bride.  Mrs. Worm and Mrs. Smith get into a discussion over growing flowers, while the men talk about local matters. In particular the pig killer describes some pigs he has killed including one that was deaf (but tasted good!) and one with rheumatism. The book also displays the cultural values of the time and place as well as the physical beauty of the countryside.<br /><br />A Pair of Blue Eyes is an early work of Hardy's and thus lacks the depth of his more developed works--Far from the Maddening Crowd, Jude the Obscure, Tess of the D'Urbervilles, to name but three. Still, it is worth reading if you understand that the ending will be tragic.sequences.     One of the joys of reading Hardy is his portrayal of ordinary people in Wessex.

Modern Americans often forget that prior to the closing of the frontier in 1890, Europeans and Native Americans co-existed along the Atlantic seaboard and American Southwest borderlands for three centuries. During that time span the cultures of both peoples changed a great deal as contact between them kept transforming the people. The consistent and steady pressure from Europeans would completely destroy the Native American cultures, causing those people to constantly form new ones only to see them battered and overwhelmed by the racist policies of Europeans and later Anglo-Americans.<br /><br />Dr. Richter is the Richard S. Dunn Director of the McNeil Center for Early American Studies at the University of Pennsylvania where he also is the Roy F. and Jeannette P. Nichols Professor of American History. He has written three other books on the colonial era that focus both on Native American and European cultures prior to the American Revolution. He earned his Ph.D from Columbia University. His choice to write this book from the Native American perspective reflects an evolution in how we look at the colonial history of North America.<br /><br />For far too long the emphasis has been to study colonial history through the lens of white settlers while ignoring the cultures of Native Americans as well as subsuming Africans arriving in the colonies under white culture. The actions of Native Americans greatly influenced the development of the colonies during the 17th century. Even as late as 1776 Native Americans outnumbered whites in North America and controlled three-quarters of the continent. After the Revolution, the development of the United States was only possible by eliminating the resistance of Native Americans in the Ohio River Valley in the 1790s. Many people today are unaware that for several years the expansion of the US hung in the balance.<br /><br />Several military defeats, including the worst defeat of American troops by Native Americans blocked westward expansion in the 1790s. While the War of 1812 ended any real resistance by tribes east of the Mississippi River, those west of the Mississippi River resisted for 75 more years. Richter keeps the attention in this book on tribes living east of the Mississippi River and between the arrival of Northern Europeans in North America, but before Jamestown, and the end of the American War of Independence. This is in keeping with his scholarly work in this time period.<br /><br /> The result is six strong chapters covering aspects of Native American life in a perpetual state of change due to the impact of white settlement in North America. Richter indicates that the Native Americans might have been in a better position prior to the Revolution than after. Looking at the time line of events he seems to be correct. It barely took a century from the end of the War of Independence to end Native American resistance to white expansion whereas they had made serious adjustments and even rebuilt stronger cultures during the three centuries preceding that event.<br /><br /> The greatest hurdle in developing any study on Native Americans prior to 1700 is the relative lack of documentation from Native Americans. Almost everything is of colonial origin. Richter used everything he could to develop this interpretation. The result is Richter’s interpretation of a Native American North America where cultures existed alongside and often intermixed with white cultures along the borders. He uses multiple sources to show how historians have seen differing versions of the same events and people which is a strong indicator that older interpretations of Native Americans must be reexamined with all available sources possible. There is a vast gulf between some of the interpretations as a result of the way sources were used.<br /><br /> All in all, this is a very good book. Some reviewers have suggested it be read with Richard White’s The Middle Ground, and I think that is a good idea. I would also suggest looking at newer explorations of Native American cultures which use a wider assortment of primary sources than many older works are based upon. This reflects the expansion of information in the digital age. Pekka Hamalainen’s The Comanche Empire is one such work along with Kathleen DuVal’s The Native Ground as another. Both books will expand upon the geographical boundaries of Richter’s work as well as time lines. Those two books, some others, and Richter’s are very interesting in that they all are transforming the way we interpret the intersection of cultures in our history.r /> All in all, this is a very good book.

He's spent his adult life searching the wilds of Celta for a cure, with no success.    Mitchella Clover's life was also changed because of disease. In a family known for its fertility, she's sterile.    When Straif hires Mitchella to renovate his Residence, on the advice of his new Fam, Drina, the attraction is immediate, but both know it can't go anywhere.    Then a distant cousin, unaffected by the genetic disorder, challenges Straif for head of the family, accusing him of neglect, and a series of escalating threats are made to Mitchella, and both of them have to determine what's most important to them.    Every time I get a new Celta story, I'm reminded again why I like them so much.

Sean Williams is the author for this adventure. The basic premise is that a SuperJedi becomes a Sith apprentice and wrecks havoc on the Rebellion. The question is, if the SuperJedi are only apprentices then how do the Sith ever lose to a punk like Luke Skywalker?<br /><br />Dust Jacket Summary: \\""The Sith always betray one another. . . . I'm sure you'll learn that soon enough.\\""<br /><br />The overthrow of the Republic is complete. The Separatist forces have been smashed, the Jedi Council nearly decimated, and the rest of the Order all but destroyed. Now absolute power rests in the iron fist of Darth Sidious-the cunning Sith lord better known as the former Senator, now Emperor, Palpatine. But more remains to be done. Pockets of resistance in the galaxy must still be defeated and missing Jedi accounted for . . . and dealt with. These crucial tasks fall to the Emperor's ruthless enforcer, Darth Vader. In turn, the Dark Lord has groomed a lethal apprentice entrusted with a top-secret mission: to comb the galaxy and dispatch the last of his masters' enemies, thereby punctuating the dark side's victory with the Jedi's doom.<br /><br />Since childhood, Vader's nameless agent has known only the cold, mercenary creed of the Sith. His past is a void; his present, the carrying out of his deadly orders. But his future beckons like a glistening black jewel with the ultimate promise: to stand beside the only father he has ever known, with the galaxy at their feet. It is a destiny he can realize only by rising to the greatest challenge of his discipleship: destroying Emperor Palpatine.<br /><br />The apprentice's journeys will take him across the far reaches of the galaxy, from the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk to the junkyard planet of Raxus Prime. On these missions, the young Sith acolyte will forge an unlikely alliance with a ruined Jedi Master seeking redemption and wrestle with forbidden feelings for his beautiful comrade, Juno Eclipse. And he will be tested as never before-by shattering revelations that strike at the very heart of all he believes and stir within him long-forgotten hopes of reclaiming his name . . . and changing his destiny.<br /><br />What I liked: A good premise. At certain parts of the story the characters represent life like beings instead of killing machines. The other positive things are the presence of Wookies and Jar Jar is never, ever mentioned. It does have a cool jacket cover.<br /><br />What I didn't like: Starkiller (the apprentice) is way too powerful in comparison with the other characters. He kills off Jedi Masters like they were droids and is able to move a crashing Star Destroyer with a flick of a finger. Starkiller goes on numerous missions that only pertain to the video game storyline and seams out place. Due to his superpowers, you never feel that Starkiller is in any danger.<br /><br />Last word: Poorly executed novel. The video game designers were allowed way too much latitude in the Star Wars universe and it shows through due to much of the nonsense that happens in the novel. I wish the author would have deviated more from the video game storyline and allowed the story to breath. This is a wasted opportunity to breach the gap between the third and fourth movies. Skip it.<br /><br />Reviewed by Mattde, Juno Eclipse.

I was using store bought white flour, basic cook book recipes and following up with lots of internet research when my bread never came out better than a pack of dry crumbs under a bland crust...no matter what advice I took.  The first thing I did after reading this book was toss out my worthless, yet beloved white-flour based sourdough starter that never offered up any flavor to my bread regardless of how I babied it.    I must warn you that unless you are prepared to dig for a reputable source for the right type of fresh flour, you had better be ready to invest in a home-mill for those truly amazing results you are hoping for.  Grocery store flour is not going to cut it for achieving a truly amazing loaf.  It is also nearly useless as a medium for a powerful sourdough starter.      I've had this book for a year while I saved up to purchase a home-mill.  The mill finally arrived last week and I have completed two loaves of the \\""loaf for learning\\"" recipe so far.  The results cannot be put into words.  This is the first time I've ended up with bread that LOOKED and TASTED like real bread.  I know my results will only improve with time and practice.    One thing I really like about this book is it is based entirely on whole wheat flour--no white flour is used in ANY of the recipes.  It also uses honey as opposed to refined sugar for any required sweetener.  Let's face it, being self-reliant is pretty useless if all your ingredients must come from a grocery store....if all else fails I can grow wheat and tend bees to keep my family in bread.    This is more a textbook than a recipe book.  It will teach you the science behind the art and the artistry of manipulating the science.  It is not for the casual baker or the faint of heart!!

His characters are complex and the moral lessons buried in their words and deeds are often quite sage.  To the extent that his work is informed by his politics, however, it lags.  He and by extension his narrators lean left.  Fine, hardly unique in the literary world in this day and age.  But his political judgments are facile and lack even an attempt at support or justification.  His \\""sacrificial lamb\\"", PFC Kendrick, is by far the weakest of the written characters in the book, and both the chronology of his story and the particulars require anyone familiar with the subject to suspend disbelief.  Amputees typically spend six months or more at Walter Reed, not six weeks, nobody was wearing DCUs in 2007, and there are few if any places for active duty service personnel to work in Connecticut save recruiting stations.  A fraction of the legwork it took to construct the chapters about Columbine could have created a plausible soldier or veteran character without undermining the homicidal/suicidal tendencies Lamb wanted to impart.  Instead we have an insufficient caricature, the embodiment of so many of the canards that people of Lamb's political inclination impute to soldiers.  Again, a fine work but it could have been better.  If Lamb wants to write work with such nakedly political themes he needs to develop his judgments and justifications with the same craftsmanship he affords mental illness, historical episodes, and the like.","2008-12-17","2008","Books"

It does indeed cover almost all of the important patterns in NLP, although the author, in all humility, has disclaimed the book to be a bible.     A greater surprise that I had, was to find that the book is not just a loose collection of patterns, but that the patterns have been very logically and systematically arranged, starting from the basic concepts of NLP, then moving on to the basic patterns and thereafter moving on to more advanced patterns. Even the big guns of NLP like Core Transformation, aligning perceptual positions, re-imprinting etc can be found very clearly as well as concisely explained. The author has also explained modelling as well as the basic modelling method. This makes the book not only useful to begining practitioners and aspiring practitioners, but also to the more experienced NLP practitioners. I think there would never come a time when I won't need the book, as long as I am using NLP in my own life, as well as helping other people change their lives for the better. In and through the pages, one cannot fail to see how much of hard work the author has put into, in learning as well as mastering the patterns. The author has identified most of the glitches and difficulties one may encounter when one tries to practice the patterns.    Any pattern, which can be too much for a beginner to practice alone, or might require expert help, the author mentions that up front. Every word that can be found in the book has been very thoughtfully written, one can find little or no fluff that one usually finds in many other books. Another notable feature is that every pattern begins by mentioning who all deserve the credits for the creation of the pattern.        The author of the book is someone who has an excellent credibility, in-depth knowledge and extensive therapeutic experience in the field of NLP and Hypnotherapy. And this book is the outcome of his own personalexperiences with trying out the patterns over the years. This book is definitely a must-read. Any one who is serious about practicing NLP should own this book.","2008-12-17","2008","Books"

It didn’t work, of course, and he was lucky to escape with his life after he had publicly  criticized the Nazis for being too violent and too left-wing.  Some of his close associates were murdered in the Night of the Long Knives in 1934; but he himself was spared, perhaps because of Hindenburg’s strong friendship for him, and he and was sent as ambassador to Austria, where he played a role in preparation for the Anschluss. He was then appointed ambassador to Turkey.  At the end of the war he was tried at Nuremberg for being party to a conspiracy to wage aggressive war, but was acquitted.  His Memoirs, published in 1952, are largely a defence of his life, though he does admit to having made mistakes and misjudgments.  He was never a member of the Nazi Party, but, even on the assumption that he is telling the truth in his Memoirs, he emerges as someone who never allowed his disgust with Nazism to stop him from serving a regime of which he describes several times as immoral and thoroughly reprehensible and which had murdered even some of his close associates.  One can only conclude that, for all his devout Catholicism and the struggles with his conscience, in the end his own moral sense was, to say the least, seriously defective.<br /><br />The memoirs are far too complex for a detailed review.  In the chapters dealing with the Weimar Republic Papen declares over and over again that he was motivated at bottom by his Christian beliefs, by a paternalistic social policy, by despair about the short-sighted politicking of the Weimar parties, by the need for constitutional reform to get rid of the proportional representation system so that a strong government could emerge (ideally he would have liked a restoration of the monarchy), opposition to the Socialist and Communists and, in foreign policy, by friendship with France on condition that France would accept Germany as an equal partner and there was an end to reparations.  Several times in his book he praises what the Western Powers have done after the Second World War:  Marshall Aid, the resistance to the Soviet Union, and the Franco-German understanding which led to the growing integration of Western Europe.<br /><br />He refutes in detail the charges that were brought against him by his opponents and by the prosecution case at Nuremberg.  He does blame Br&uuml;ning for not strengthening his weak position by bringing the right-wing parties (including the Nazis) into his government (believing that, if that had been done early enough, they would have to behave more responsibly!).  He denies that he plotted against Schleicher in revenge for Schleicher having secured his dismissal in December 1932 and he claims that his approaches to Hitler in January 1933 had as their aim to get Hitler to accept office under Schleicher, and that only when that failed, and at the behest of Hindenburg, did he agree to the deal which made Hitler Chancellor and himself Vice-Chancellor.<br /><br />In the next chapter Papen immediately sets out how, but also why, he had misjudged Hitler (as millions of Germans also did).  His disillusionment began with the arbitrary arrests by Goering’s police and the violence of the Brownshirts, the latter of which Hitler appeared angrily to disown.  Papen claims to have opposed Nazi antisemitism and to have persuaded Hinndenburg to insist that Jewish ex-servicemen should be excluded from the early antisemitic laws.  He says he protested in vain against Hitler’s decision to leave the League of Nations - but then, believing Hitler’s pronouncements that Germany was committed to a peaceful foreign policy, publicly pledged his support for it.  And he lists a number of topics on which, sometimes successfully, sometimes unsuccessfully, he tried to modify or change Hitler’s policies.  After Hitler had banned all parties except his own and when the left wing of the party led by Roehm called for a second revolution, on June 17th Papen made his famous speech at Marburg in whih he publicly  attacked both the dictatorship and the idea of a second revolution.  When Goebbels tried to suppress the speech, Papen threatened to resign and Hitler, fearing that Hindenburg might then dismiss him, forced Goebbels to rescind the censorship.  Twelve days later, on June 29th, came was the Night of the Long Knives, in which not only the Brownshirt leaders were shot, but also two members of Von Papen’s staff, and Von Papen himself was put under house arrest.  He says that he learnt later that only Goering stood between him and execution - but why that was is not at all clear.  When the house arrest was lifted, he submitted his resignation, but Hitler did not allow it to be published until August 17th, by which time Papen had been made Minister (later Ambassador) to Austria.<br /><br />The relations between Germany and Austria had been bad, and Papen was known to have been a personal friend of Dollfuss, the Austrian Chancellor, and to have urged Hitler to withdraw some hostile legislation he had enacted.  But then on July 25th the Austrian Nazis assassinated Dollfuss;  Mussolini, not yet an ally of Germany, had mobilized his troops and Germany was not in a position as yet to fight a war.  Hitler, in a panic, disowned the murder and Papen was sent to Vienna as a token of friendship.  It is astonishing that Hitler should have chosen Papen, but even more so that Papen, who had submitted his  resignation from the Cabinet, should have agreed to go on serving Hitler - and the arguments he gives for his decision are unconvincing.<br /><br />Papen, like most Germans believed in the desirability of an Anschluss, but in one to be brought about by agreement between the Germans and the Austrians in part because he believed that a violent Anschluss might provoke a general war.  Hitler had promised him that the process should be based on the peaceful consent of both countries.  An Austro-German agreement to this effect had actually been signed in June 1936.  There are then three almost impenetrable chapters about the Byzantine complications of Austrian internal politics and Papen’s dealings with the various parties.  Papen constantly urged Hitler to maintain good relations with Austria by keeping the illegal Austrian Nazis under control and urged Schuschnigg, the Austrian Chancellor, to work with pro-German but non-Nazi politicians.  On February 4th 1938 Papen was dismissed, though he was still instrumental in bringing about - and being present at - the meeting at Berchtesgaden on February 12th between Hitler and Schuschnigg, at Papen managed to reduce some of Hitler’s terms, after which Schuschnigg seemed to capitulated to the rest of them.  But then Schuschnigg called for a referendum on Austrian independence, which led to the German Army marching into Austria, to Papen’s dismay - and relief that foreign intervention, which he had feared, did not materialize.<br /><br />Papen was awarded the Gold Medal of the Nazi Party - but one of his close but indiscreet aides, whom Papen had entrusted with the task of sending his papers to Switzerland, was murdered by the Gestapo.  Papen says that he expected to be arrested himself, but instead he was offered the post of ambassador to Turkey, which he twice refused in 1938 and early 1939 before - without any convincing explanation - accepting it in April that year.<br /><br />There he several times clashed and even defied his boss, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, but was kept in post.  After Stalingrad he was in touch with General Beck and other secret opposition leaders in Germany who were planning to overthrow Hitler provided the Allies withdrew their insistence on Germany’s unconditional surrender,  and Papen actually approached the Americans, but his American intermediary met with Roosevelt’s refusal.  Soon after D-Day the Turks, succumbing to Allied pressure, severed relationships with Germany (August 2nd, 1944) and Papen was ordered home immediately.  On July 25th, 1944, the plot by Beck and others to kill Hitler had failed, and the consiprators were in prison and about to be executed - and Papen had sent a telegram of congratulations to Hitler on his survival.  On August 2nd the Turks, succumbing to Allied pressure, severed relationships with Germany and Papen was ordered home immediately.

At the Nuremberg trials (1945/46) he was not charged with war crimes or crimes against humanity - merely to have conspired to wage war.  Principally the prosecution centred on his role in planning the forcible take-over of Austria; and the Court in end accepted the case stated in earlier parts of this memoir: that, on the contrary, Papen had always urged against a forcible Anschluss.  He was set free, only to be immediately re-arrested by the  new Socialist Bavarian government. He was brought before a Denazification Court and sentenced to eight years in a labour camp. Much of his imprisonment was spent in camp hospitals, and on appeal he was released in January 1949.<br /><br />He died in 1969.se he believed that a violent Anschluss might provoke a general war.  Hitler had promised him that the process should be based on the peaceful consent of both countries.  An Austro-German agreement to this effect had actually been signed in June 1936.  There are then three almost impenetrable chapters about the Byzantine complications of Austrian internal politics and Papen’s dealings with the various parties.  Papen constantly urged Hitler to maintain good relations with Austria by keeping the illegal Austrian Nazis under control and urged Schuschnigg, the Austrian Chancellor, to work with pro-German but non-Nazi politicians.  On February 4th 1938 Papen was dismissed, though he was still instrumental in bringing about - and being present at - the meeting at Berchtesgaden on February 12th between Hitler and Schuschnigg, at Papen managed to reduce some of Hitler’s terms, after which Schuschnigg seemed to capitulated to the rest of them.  But then Schuschnigg called for a referendum on Austrian independence, which led to the German Army marching into Austria, to Papen’s dismay - and relief that foreign intervention, which he had feared, did not materialize.<br /><br />Papen was awarded the Gold Medal of the Nazi Party - but one of his close but indiscreet aides, whom Papen had entrusted with the task of sending his papers to Switzerland, was murdered by the Gestapo.  Papen says that he expected to be arrested himself, but instead he was offered the post of ambassador to Turkey, which he twice refused in 1938 and early 1939 before - without any convincing explanation - accepting it in April that year.<br /><br />There he several times clashed and even defied his boss, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, but was kept in post.  After Stalingrad he was in touch with General Beck and other secret opposition leaders in Germany who were planning to overthrow Hitler provided the Allies withdrew their insistence on Germany’s unconditional surrender,  and Papen actually approached the Americans, but his American intermediary met with Roosevelt’s refusal.  Soon after D-Day the Turks, succumbing to Allied pressure, severed relationships with Germany (August 2nd, 1944) and Papen was ordered home immediately.  On July 25th, 1944, the plot by Beck and others to kill Hitler had failed, and the consiprators were in prison and about to be executed - and Papen had sent a telegram of congratulations to Hitler on his survival.

It is just too cute, which made me expect a FUN vampire book. (2) Beth Fantaskey is such a cool name that it doesn't sound real. I refer, of course, to Fantaskey, which sounds so much like both Fantasy and Fantastic.<br /><br />The book has a little trouble going back and forth between cute and serious. Our story begins early in Jessica Packwood's senior year. She's crushing on a sweet farm boy, only to be rudely interrupted by a Romanian foreign exchange student named Lucius Vladescu. The newcomer wears a billowing white shirt and black boots and tells Jessica she's his fiance. Vampire fiance, to be exact. All of which irritates Jessica no end. She's unwilling to accept the idea that she might be a vampire, let alone that she's engaged to an arrogant stranger.<br /><br />It's a little hard to launch a book with a cute personality tussle and then have it evolve so darkly, even though readers might expect a certain amount of darkness in a vampire book. The tug-of-war between cute and somber continues as Jessica is given a book called Growing Up Undead: A Teen Vampire's Guide to Dating, Health, and Emotions. And Lucius's letters home are a funny, clever counterpart to Jessica's narration. But then the plot gets more and more heavy, with references to child abuse, murder, skankiness, jealousy, and Lucius's extreme (hard-to-believe) dark side.<br /><br />It's also a challenge not to compare every post-Twilight book about teen vampires unfavorably to Twilight, especially in light of the sneaking suspicion that all of the books are more or less inspired by Twilight. (This happened with a lot of post-Harry Potter fantasy, too!)<br /><br />At any rate, Jessica eventually relents in her feelings about Lucius, right about when he gives up on her and starts dating the class slut. Then Lucius's abusive Transylvanian uncles show up to punish him for not winning Jessica's heart. By the time all's said and done, Jessica must not only deal with Lucius, she must also stop a clan-type vampire war.<br /><br />Some of the plot evolutions were a little bumpy--okay, not completely convincing--but Lucius and Jessica both grew on me. Teen fans of vampire fiction might like this book, as long as they can manage to keep Edward and Bella from peering over their shoulders while they read.must also stop a clan-type vampire war.

I was, in fact, addicted to the novels of Victoria Holt for several years and probably read most of those available at the time.  This one stuck in my mind, and when I had the urge to read Holt again, it was the first one I looked for.<br /><br />I must say that Holt is not a great writer.  Her narrative is often clumsy, with exposition that is often so obvious it makes my head hurt.  However, in spite of that, and in spite of stretches of text which move very slowly, I thoroughly enjoyed rereading this book.  Possibly it has to do with the memory of my youth, but I think it's more than that.  I think that in spite of her technical shortcomings, Holt does manage to capture the genuine quality of a good gothic.  There is mystery and danger here, and a heroine who, though egregiously manipulated by external forces is never feckless.  And there is fade-to-black sex, which is sort of refreshing in a genre which has become dominated by heaving bosoms and raging manhoods loosely bound together by a bit of plotishness.<br /><br />Gothics are a very specific taste, so I'm not going to assume that everyone who loves romances will love this novel.  Rather, I'd say that if you enjoy stories about love against the odds, dusted with some darkness and mystery, then you may well enjoy On the Night of the Seventh Moon.","2008-12-17","2008","Books"

The discussion is primarily about ethics in business and government. But we all make ethical decisions all the time... at work, at school, at church, at clubs and groups we belong to, and in our personal life.<br /><br />\\""ethics {for the real world}\\"" addresses these issues in our daily lives. The subtitle of the book is \\""creating a personal code to guide decisions in work and life\\"".<br /><br />I've read a couple of textbooks on ethics in my day. But this is the first book I've read that addresses this topic in the style of a \\""self help\\"" book, addressed at the average person. The book is very readable, and easy to understand. There is much more emphasis on practical applications of ethics, than on abstract concepts and theory.<br /><br />The book guides the reader through three basic areas of ethical behavior (lying, stealing and harming); making a distinction between three types of decision criteria (prudential, legal and ethical); and making decisions based on positive vs negative ethical constructs, and on action-based vs consequence-based theory. There is also discussion of some basic ethical \\""touchstones\\"": religion, secular and work.<br /><br />The remainder of the book guides the reader through drafting a personal code of ethics, and then applying it to their personal and professional lives. There are three examples of ethical codes in the appendix.<br /><br />There are many examples in the book of situations that require ethical decision making. The questions posed in these examples are not always easy, and the authors make it more complex by suggesting alternative decisions or paths of reasoning.<br /><br />This book gave me a lot to think about. I did a fairly quick read-through for this review, but I am going to go back and read it again more slowly and carefully, work through the examples and exercises, and work up my own personal code of ethics. But even on my first quick reading, I've caught myself a few times when I was about to make a decision, and had to think about what would be the \\""ethical thing to do\\"".had to think about what would be the \\""ethical thing to do\\"".","2008-12-17","2008","Books"

Bors says, \\""I cannot say this strongly enough: teacher interpretation of physical behavior is critical in the instruction of young men.\\"" What makes Bors's book unique is that it is not based soley on the neurological and psychological theories of brain development, but also on data collected in a real life classroom setting.  While I have observed teachers naturally utilizing competition in the classroom, no one has investigated how and why this approach is so effective with boys. The author legitimizes the use of challenge and competition in the classroom. Bors explains how to motivate and challenge young men and provides hands on methods for implementing and replicating her successful strategies.

I have also hired (and let go) one employee recently, so I thought I would compare my experiences with the advice in this book.    The book contains some useful information about different forms that employers need to fill out when hiring an employee, and ideas on what types of questions to ask prospective employees.  But I feel that some of the information is not in a streamlined format.  For instance, tax info is towards the end of the book, and I think that really should be a top consideration and in the front of the book as one of the first things you need to think about.    The book tries to point the reader in the right direction for more help on certain topics (ie tax forms, state laws, etc), but I found some of the info on state law summaries left out some states (including mine), but did not say whether it was done deliberately.  So readers in those states will have to research on their own, and if you don't have a clue where to start, this book will not help you.    All in all, if you have no clue about what you are in for if you hire an employee, you might find some helpful information in this book.  But if you have already hired an employee for your small business, you may not find this book very useful.","2008-12-17","2008","Books"

I thought he was a great, convicted guy-I-love-to-hate character and was really excited to read more about him, perhaps of his past and why he turned, etc. So the climax at the end with him... just didn't play out the way I had hoped for such a vibrant character.

His story tells of the various industries' scientific and technical \\""whores\\"" who sell their expertise to either create doubt about, or directly challenge the legitimate science that is produced for science sake - not profit.      However, the underlying tale is far more onerous than the title expresses. It is not much of a stretch to understand that the nature of science is being seriously subverted.  Science builds upon itself. All future work in the medical sciences will have to be cautious when using data produced by these charlatans.  Some of that data will, in fact, be totally false.    If this is allowed to continue, science will one day acquire the reputation now currently reserved for used-car salesmen, and streetwalkers.  The problem is far greater than any of us would like to think about.  Bravo Dr. Michaels.","2008-12-17","2008","Books"

The story does provide, however, an insight into a basically good and sincere person with his own set of demons to fight. I particularly liked the chapter titled a \\""Hardscrabble Christmas\\"" (a very heart warming story about Sam Grant's 1857 Christmas at his home near St. Louis called \\""Hardscrabble\\"" for, as the name implies, a farm with poor soil).

How To Win Them Over!m19th Edition","5","31","32","N","Y","This is the Writer's Bible","First of all, let me start by saying I was a little intimidated by the sheer size of this book.  At 1,075 pages, it resembled the Cliff Notes for War and Peace.  But being the voracious reader that I am, I looked at it in a positive light.  I was definitely going to get my money's worth.  You've heard the old saying, `You get what you pay for?'  Well, I got a wealth of indispensable information.<br /><br />This book is a must have for any author or aspiring writer hoping and dreaming to one day, become published.  I initially purchased this book to get a list of agents who might be interested in representing a romance novel I'd recently written (which by the way, in my opinion, is the greatest romance ever written, but I haven't been able to convince anyone else of this fact, except my mother and my husband.  And they don't count, because by default, they're obligated to tell me wonderful things about myself).<br /><br />But Jeff's book was so much more than just a simple listing of agents.  Not only does it contain a detailed summary of each editor, agent and publishing house ever known to human-kind, it also provides personal information, hobbies and recent book sales on the aforementioned parties.  I appreciated the depth of the research involved in this endeavor.  After two years of desperately searching for an agent, I thought I'd harassed every one - but this book showed me that I had not yet exhausted all the possibilities.<br /><br />In addition to background information on publishing houses, this book provides the following:<br /><br />* Instructions on how to approach/write/query/contact agents and editors<br />* A sample contract between an author and an agency<br />* The publishing process and how a book ends up - well, published<br />* A day in the life of a literary agent<br />* Advice for dealing with editors and agents<br />* Definitions of book genres and the future of publishing<br />* How to market yourself as a writer<br />* A list of writing groups/critique groups to help refine your manuscript<br />* Information on self-publishing and e-publishing<br />* A detailed list of websites and other resources for writers<br /><br />This book truly exceeded my expectations.  I gained invaluable knowledge about writing and the publishing business in general that I believe has made me a better writer.  In fact, I'm thinking of contacting Jeff and telling him to republish it with a different title - The Writer's Bible.  Once you read it, you may just agree with me.t  * Information on self-publishing and e-publishing   * A detailed list of websites and other resources for writers    This book truly exceeded my expectations.

Viola's hoofdargument tegen de Reformatie is, dat het priesterschap van alle gelovigen wel wordt beleden, maar niet doorgetrokken is naar de praxis van gemeente zijn. Met een aanhoudende scheiding tussen leken en kader, een prominente rol voor de leraar en het uitbouwen van leerstellingen ten aanzien van kerkinrichting, bedieningen, ambten en dergelijke op basis van enkele schriftgedeelten die vaak uit verband gerukt zijn. Reimagining Church bestaat uit twee delen. In het eerste deel staat de gemeenschap en samenkomsten centraal. Wat betekent het om de gemeente als organisme te zien? Wat dragen de huidige diensten en samenkomsten in jouw en mijn kerk of gemeente uit? Wat zegt de Bijbel echt over de maaltijd van de Heer, de plaats om samen te komen? Wat betekent het om gezin van God te vormen? Besef je hoe de goddelijke Drieëenheid exemplarisch moet zijn voor de gemeente? En is nu het Kruis de belangrijkste mijlpaal in Gods plan, of wil Hij meer en nog andere dingen doen met zijn Kerk?<br /><br />Deel twee adreseert een groot aantal menselijke instituties die, zoals gezegd, vaak een zwakke of helemaal geen basis hebben in de Bijbel zelf. Leiderschap, opzienerschap, besluitvorming, geestelijke dekking, verantwoordelijkheid, wie is nu de baas / eindverantwoordelijke van de kerk? Autoriteit, onderwerping, nut en noodzaak van een denominatie en de betekenis van de apostolische traditie. In een appendix behandelt Frank Viola nog een aantal bezwaren ten aanzien van zijn stellingname over leiderschap, bekende argumenten en leringen die je in allerlei kerken over dit onderwerp tegenkomt.<br /><br />Viola geeft niet alleen kritiek, staat open voor correctie, waakt voor succesverhalen, maar geeft ook oplossingen en bijbels gefundeerde alternatieven. Zo'n boek laat je als lezer niet koud. Wat je ermee doet, kan weerstand oproepen, mensen wakker schudden en gemeenten letterlijk en figuurlijk hervormen. Met de Bruid van Christus op het oog, staat er ook heel wat op het spel! Ik ben Viola erg dankbaar voor Reimagining Church.

People have been leaving the O'Sullivan brothers for years and it only makes sense that the girl who appeared out of nowhere should leave just as suddenly.<br /><br />Finn O'Sullivan knows that Roza didn't just leave. And he knows that he didn't do anything to save her.<br /><br />Months later most everyone in Bone Gap has given up pretending to believe Finn's story about the man who took Roza. Even Finn's brother, Sean, is tired of hearing about the man with the unique stillness and the face Finn can never quite describe.<br /><br />Finn refuses to stop looking. His search will take him deep into the secrets of Bone Gap to places he couldn't imagine. In trying to find Roza, Finn will learn that sometimes you have to stop looking before you can truly see in Bone Gap (2015) by Laura Ruby.<br /><br />Bone Gap is a rich and atmospheric novel. The town of Bone Gap is a strange place filled with secrets and magic that most people have forgotten. In a town populated with strange and vivid characters even Bone Gap itself becomes an indelible part of this novel that is firmly grounded with a strong sense of place.<br /><br />Some would call Bone Gap magic realism but references to fairy tales and magic bring a purer form of fantasy to mind in this story where beauty can be a curse and being blind is sometimes the best way to see.<br /><br />Bone Gap masterfully blends myth and magic in a contemporary setting to create a thoughtful story filled with unlikely heroes, surprising twists and a plot that expertly subverts traditional fairytale tropes. Bone Gap is a lovely, unexpected novel that is incredibly smart. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Possible Pairings: The Vanishing Season by Jodi Lynn Anderson, Wonder Show by Hannah Barnaby, The Rose and the Beast by Francesca Lia Block, Blackfin Sky by Kat Ellis, The Lost Sun by Tessa Gratton, We Were Liars by E.

The characters take a while to develop and the devices which the writers employ to tell the tale can get rather tiresome in places.<br /><br />The story is told in two voices, one is Jameson, the portrait painter from England and the other is is would-be mistriss, Fanny Easton/Weston, his female-hiding-as-male apprentice.<br /><br />This book interested me on two levels; it's historical in nature and it deals with the creation of art in the time of the American Revolution, namely portraiture. I received it as a Vine program product and while I'm glad I didn't have to purchase it,  I'm also glad I stuck with it to the end.<br /><br />The devices employed to tell the story are A. Jameson writing a book in first person and B. Fanny Easton writing letters to a relative.  The first is fairly successful, but the second is a real stretch for me, as most letters do not relate full conversations and scenery in such detail. The authors pushed this a bit far and in my opinion, they would have done well to let Jameson tell most of the tale and Weston relate it briefly in truer letter form.<br /><br />Those who love history will be pleased, the language and form of writing is true to the period. Those who love a juicy love story will be pleased, Weston's love for Jameson with the spice of her hidden identity and eventual reveal as a woman make for some fast page turning. Those who love gender-bending situations will get a kick as well.  Be warned, it is somewhat racy in places. This is where the writers truly break with history, as a book of this bawdy nature would have seen them to the gallows if written in that time.<br /><br />I liked the book but didn't love the book. It could use some editing and the writing style is somewhat tedious in places. However, this could be due to the authors trying to stick to the style of the period and so, for that, I forgive them.","2008-12-17","2008","Books"

The fascination standpoint comes from getting a 'view and feel' for how Christian prophecy writers viewed the times back in the late 1970's.  The utility of the book is in its many tips and detailed plans of how to survive in a time of calamity.  This portion of the book is relevant to both Christian and non-Christian alike.  The reader will also get a biopic of just how far the pervasion of 'political correctness' has sunk into the minds of ordinary American's, without it seeming so.

Russo is known as the &#34;living legend&#34; with 20 published books world wide and 19 feature films which include Return of the Living Dead, Midnight, The Majorettes, The Awakening, and Heartstopper.<br /><br />By reading the back of the book you quickly learn about a young group of conspiracy buffs who go to Texas where the assassination of President Kennedy happened to film a reenactment. When I started reading the book I felt the book was going at a good pace and kept me wanting to see what happens. In the first few chapters you learn about 4 killings, that become the first of many murders in the book. After the murders take place the book, I felt, had slowed down quite a bit. You will notice that the book takes you through the Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush[SR.], Clinton, and Bush[JR.] administrations to the end of the book. As you keep reading you learn that what happened on that day in 1964 would lead up to horrific events 40 years later. There is many mentions of racism, violence, and similarities to that of Hitler in Nazi Germany.<br /><br />As I mentioned above I enjoyed reading this book for the first few chapters, up until right after the murders took place. After that I felt that it had slowed down, too much for my liking. There was a lot of going back and forth and I think that there should have been more focus on a specific character, as well as have more engaging moments to keep the reader going. Overall I think the plot of the book was great, just needed a little &#34;oomph&#34;.<br /><br />I received this product for free for reviewing purposes.

There's an element of horror and some suspense and fantasy, all of which go over well with young adult readers.      Fifteen-year-old Xander King is not happy about the move his family is making from L.A. to rural Pinedale.  He is moving away from his friends and from what he sees as his chance to become a film maker.  Xander knows his dad has a reason for moving the family, but he wonders if it's a good one, particularly since his dad says he can't get into it.  Yet.    In their search for a house, the Kings come across a run-down Victorian, and that's when weird things start happening.  Sounds are distorted like they are in a fun house at a carnival.  There's a mystery intruder that might actually be Bigfoot.  Xander and his brother, David, are even transported from place to place.  The house is affordable for the Kings, but is that because a woman was murdered there long ago and no one else wants it?  Will the strange things that happen in the house lead to murder again?    I enjoyed reading about the different things the King children discovered in the \\""house of dark shadows.\\""  The book's title reminded me of the vampire, Barnabas Collins, that was in the TV series DARK SHADOWS, but the things that go on in the King's new house aren't about vampires, although they are certainly mysterious.

For some reason, when she divorced her husband Angelo, she was afraid to take her daughter with her back to America, and gave him custody.<br /><br />But a few years later, her daughter doesn't want to live with him any more due to his fawning over his new wife, who is a saint, and has money. So Olivia goes to New York to stay with Caroline.<br /><br />I didn't like either character.  Olivia was a snotty, greedy, self-centered brat, and Caroline was an ignorant wimpy doormat. The book is mostly repetition of Caroline warning Olivia to not get pregnant (at 15 dating a 27 year old man) over and over, Olivia rudely snapping back, and of course getting pregnant.  Since she's a good Catholic, she will have the baby, but at great cost to her mental health...and everyone else's in the family who must put up with her.  Also, she somehow manages to stay 17 years old for over 14 months. Caroline pretty much does whatever Olivia tells her to do, although she is offering her good advice, left and right, Olivia refuses it all, but that's okay, Mama will clean up all her messes.<br /><br />Just a story with no point, except that blind allegiance to religion interferes with common sense, but I don't think that's what the author was really going for.","2008-12-17","2008","Books"

All the chapters have lots of references and citations to the original articles where the intermediate steps are explained, but the book is not self contained.     The good part of the book is that here one can find lots of things that are research subject all together.

When the room starts eating children I was real scared, it blurs the lines of reality and fantasy in a twisted way.

(One almost needs to live in S. Florida to comprehend how much violent crime is part of the fabric of life down there, in a way that is inconceivable to most Americans). Of course, he acknowledges the hypocrisy of the move to Boca in this book, but not the true source of hypocrisy. Palm Beach County, where he moved from - which he has NO harsh words for - is heavily Jewish and Democratic. It is where all that \\""hanging chad\\"" stuff took place in the 2000 Presidential election (more hypocrisy - it was Democratic Party operatives who selected the ballot system which failed in Palm Beach County in 2000, and then they didn't want to live by the results their own system generated!).<br /><br />So, in John Grogan we find a man who is tolerant, and even finds charm in a chaotic and destructive dog, which he couldn't hold accountable, and his attitude strikes a chord with his fellow liberals in Palm Beach County, where life is chaotic, destructive and criminals are not caught and held accountable. Undoubtedly (one has to first understand the publishing world) that is why this book has been caught up by the liberal publishing world and pumped up into a bestseller. Now we find that Hollywood, where chaos, destructive lives, and lack of accountability are endemic, is enamored with the story.<br /><br />How I would have handled Marley if he had been my dog, I can't say for sure. I can say this - Part of responsible dog ownership is to first do one's research before acquiring a dog. He found out only after buying Marley that the type of Lab he got (of the two) was unsuitable for home ownership. Later on, he waxes philosophical about all the lessons he learned about having a carefree, destructive dog around all the time, and what the experience taught him about life; the good things it taught him. To me that is like buying a Black Bear cub, raising it in a suburban home, and then waxing philosophical about all the positives lessons you learned from letting the bear tear up your house and terrorize the neighborhood.<br /><br />Despite the animus I feel toward the author, one can't help love Marley - at least I can't help love Marley, because I love most dogs. He would have been much better served under the loving care of a duck-hunter, outdoorsman type who could have allowed Marley to function in an outdoor environment suitable to a strong hunting dog. To me, Grogan might even be guilty of exploitation - he exploited an outdoor hunting-type dog so it would bring the wild and out-of-doors into his predictable, suburban, boring life; sort of like people who cruelly maintain Bengal Tigers in apartments in big cities. With this last point in mind, recall that Grogan also bashes \\""Republican\\"" residents of Boca Raton for principally owing lap dogs, like Poodles and Bijon-Frise's, which in fact is a sign of caring and responsibility on the part of those Boca residents, who understand that the South Florida environment, where dogs are not allowed at the beach; where there are no woods for a dog to run in, and where fleas make outdoor life almost impossible for most dogs, is not good place for dogs like Marley.<br /><br />I'm providing a link to a book about a man who owned a wild-type dog, which is not only an incredible story, but in which the owner ultimately makes a very tough, unselfish choice forthe welfare of the dog. This book, North Runner, is the best dog book I have read to-date -[[ASIN:1896219667 The North Runner]]er, is the best dog book I have read to-date -[[ASIN:1896219667 The North Runner]]","2008-12-17","2008","Books"

Gardner has a way with words and these are a humorous, tongue-in-cheek collection of original fairy tales. Each contains elemental tropes from the traditional fairy tales and one is even styled (very) loosely after an actual Grimm tale. But these are Gardiner's very own through and through with modern humour making them so gleefully successful. I was delighted with his writing in each story but certainly found the first two stories highly superior to the last two. Each story has two gorgeous illustrations reproduced in black and white; however, from memory I seem to recall that the hardcover had full colour illustrated panes. This book was awarded the NYT Outstanding Book for Children 1975.<br /><br />1. Dragon, Dragon - Absolutely hilarious! This tale follows the usual three brothers fairy tale. Here, each, starting with the eldest who is clever, then the middle who is strong, goes off to slay the dragon and fails, until the youngest who is nervous and slender but a good boy who listens to his elders. All the usual tropes in this type of tale are used, but Gardner turns it on its head by adding hilarious humour that had me grinning the whole time. (5/5)<br /><br />2. The Tailor and the Giant - Based on the Grimm tale, but really not following the plot at all. Very funny tale where the giant terrorizes the town the first Monday of every month and the tailor basically has agoraphobia and social anxiety but becomes the hero in the end. I love the writing style and the humour is tongue-in-cheek delightful. (5/5)<br /><br />3. The Miller's Mule - A mule is too old to work and the miller is going to shoot him, but the mule says he will make him rich if he spares his life. However, the mule is a wicked creature who tries to get the miller killed. This one is a bit of a let down after the first too. Not really that funny, at least it falls flat for me and, I know this sounds like a foolish thing to say about silly fairytales, but this story lacks logic making it hard to get into to the magical realism. It's readable, though. I'm enjoying this author's writing. (3/5)<br /><br />4. The Last Piece of Light - Quite an original fairytale with a bit of a modern feel to it at first but then we get a king and further in a prince, but settle into a Victorian feel when we meet the chimney sweep. In this story, the saviour is the Lady of the North Star who uses a female chimney sweep to become the hero and in a turn from the norm Chimorra ends up saving the Prince. A quaint feel good tale, but Gardner's humorous twist is that everyone is as dumb as a doornail. Chimorra is the only one with any bit of sense and that is even minimal as she forgets her magic words to save the world and even forgets she's forgotten! But we like Chimorra and don't feel any frustration with her as she goes through the usual fairytale tragedy upon tragedy until the happy, but, strange ending.

Like the majority of Dartmouth students/alums I was skeptical about anything that portrayed our school in a negative light , but then I actually read this book and realized that Lohse hits on the exact criticisms I hear from students on a daily basis about Dartmouth’s Greek system. The difference is…he actually did something about it.<br /><br />This book is gratifyingly honest, captivating, and at times really funny. Even if in places the writing does not live up to masterpiece status, Lohse makes up for it in his acute and insightful observations- observations that many Dartmouth students fail to come to on their own. Lohse succeeds in his articulation and synthesis of the many problems that plague Dartmouth’s Greek system.<br /><br />Because Dartmouth is a fiercely loyal school, unable to “let the old traditions fail,” it takes a significant amount of courage to speak out against it. Lohse recognized that something was not right and felt compelled to tell his story to incite positive change at the school.

I am ecstatic to own this bag of tricks to learn faster and decide more accurately.  My only minor nit as one who studies psychophysiology is that it claims to be based on the latest findings in cognitive neuroscience and academic psychology.  It is rather the results of a master programmer and consultant's search for better techniques that he and others can use to learn more quickly and more efficiently exploit professional knowledge.  In that this book succeeds in its purpose offering many valuable heuristics, some of which everyone will find valuable (such as using what is known about how expertise is acquired and applying that knowledge to forming one's own learning program), and some which only some readers will find suits their ways of thinking (like the emphasis on using a particular type of mind map to explore a problem).  An example of where this books method's are personal and popular rather than science-based include the popular conception of left and right-brain thought processes.  This book and many others attempt to connect their methods of thinking about problems with a variety of focused and holistic viewpoints with Roger Sperry's research on split-brained patients.  Modern neuroscience and functional brain imaging techniques show that the way the brain engages with problem solving is a much more complex picture using a variety of whole brain and localized functions.  For example see [...] and<br />linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1046202306003100. But like most readers I am mainly concerned with what valuable information and techniques I can learn to improve my personal and professional life.

But it has one of the best, and most accessible, discussions of how to value a business I've ever read.  Many times I've used similar \\""thought experiments\\"", attempting to reduce the complexities of publicly traded companies' financials to simple, but realistic examples, like Vitaliy does with \\""Tevye the Milkman\\"" and his cows.<br /><br />It was sometime after that initial read, and while I was re-reading selected sections that I realized this is a VERY GOOD book.  And now, in that way we all have of simplifying concepts, when people ask me about my investment perspective, I kind of just point  to Vitaliy.  \\""He says it best.\\""  I counter that deification by keeping the book on top of the toilet.<br /><br />Aside from the character Tevye, the main take away for me is about when, and why, to sell.  Vitaliy makes a convincing case that we are destined to spend decades in range-bound markets, especially after long bull runs like the end of the 20th century.  But from the inside, the ranges are large enough that we don't really see it, but instead experience it as separate bull and bear markets.  The difference is that by the end of the long range period, there has been no net progress.  Knowing that in advance, being able to see \\""outside the range\\"", seeing the box we're in for what it is - that's what this book is about.","2008-12-17","2008","Books"

I love how he paces the longer and shorter stories.     Few writers deliver the funny as well as McNally -- and he does it without being jokey. Take 'The Something Something' which has Gene Siskel screening a film with Roger Ebert. Siskel can't behave himself in the theater. He slurps coffee, talks and shoots spitballs at Ebert. It's a comic setup but ends with a twist.    'I See Johnny' is one of the best stories I've ever read. Comics say they killed when the audience belongs to them. I'm not sure what writers say when they write a great story -- smashed it? Maybe 'killed' is the right word and McNally did just that.    Most story collections have clunkers. Not this one. Most story collections don't drive you on to read the next page and the next like a good novel. This one does.    The lovely thing about McNally isn't just his wonderful prose style or his gift for voice -- no, it's his perspective, how he sees things.    Have you ever imagined Roger Ebert holding Gene Siskel over his head? Yeah, me neither. McNally did.","2008-12-17","2008","Books"

So it was with a certain amount of poignancy that I just finished it and did my own reflections on this full and wonderful life.<br /><br />Not all of the book holds equal fascination but I was delighted to read about his growing up in Archery, Georgia where he was among the few white families who lived there.

It's a real treat.<br /><br />&#34;A Full Life&#34; is written more as an overview to President Carter's years, rather than an in-depth look at most given issues, either personal or political. Yet there is such a wide array of material upon which he comments to make the book a worthy read. His triumphs are measured carefully and one can understand the hurt that he and his family endured during the downsides. This is a very good book and I recommend it, especially to those who may need an introduction to our thirty-ninth president.

Konigsburg (amongst others). While the superficial subject of the book is religion and the creation thereof, it's really all about growing up and learning to navigate the world without losing oneself. It does this through the plot of Jason Bock's experiment with religion creation and the effect it has on his friends.    One of the nice aspects of the novel is that although it raises doubts about the validity of organized religion - especially modern religions such as Scientology or Mormonism - it does not ultimately suggest that everyone should become atheist or agnostic. Rather, though the main character is an agnostic throughout, other characters are religious without condemnation.    Even though the novel doesn't condemn religiousity, it does ask the reader to think critically about faith and religion through the creation of Chutengodianism by the main characters. If Jason created this religion as a joke, knowing full well that the water tower is not actually a god, then who is to say that other religions weren't created the same way? But even while the novel asks this question, it shows how the water tower is a god of sorts (it provides all the water for the community, which allows them to live, for example) and students of mythology will recognize that this line of thought is how other gods have been created - think of Apsu and Tiamat, Gaea and Ouranos, or Ra and Nu.    The novel's religious theme asks the reader to recognize that religions are man-made, fallible things. Yet they are powerful, too, as Shin's obsession with Chutengodianism causes him to place himself in danger. Even so, it does not deny that many people derive comfort from their faiths, nor that there is a place for religion in societies, no matter how they came about. It is a mixed-bag sort of ending, providing support for both theism and atheism.      Probably the take-away message of thebook is to not take everything at face value. Just as religions are exposed as having shady origins (compared to how they're touted by the faithful), Jason learns that people, too, are not always as they seem on the surface. Henry Stagg, for example, is a science-fiction fan and someone Jason discovers he could be great friends with, despite having previously thought Henry to be no more than an ignorant thug type.      I can't say that this is a book I would recommend to just any teenager, because I know that many would scoff at the title and the plot and not read closely enough to recognise the life lessons it has inside. But I think it's as good as any other for those people struggling with what it means to believe in the modern era, and could be a comfort for them.","2008-12-17","2008","Books"

But the truth is that I'm much more drawn to the Marvel Universe of super heroes and I've tended to spend most of my time there.  Still, having recently caught up on Grant Morrison's stunning retelling of the X-Men, I decided it was time to read his even more highly praised Superman stories.<br /><br />What I was instantly struck by was the way it was all written as if in response to a challenge, as if he'd been given a task for a master's class in comic book writing:<br /><br />Assignment -- Write a series of stand-alone issues dealing with one of the major mythic elements of the Superman legend, attacking that aspect in a completely original yet completely engaging way.  In this volume we see:<br /><br />A new wrinkle on Superman himself<br />A Lois Lane story unlike any other<br />A brilliant Jimmy Olsen story<br />A Lex Luthor issue<br />An origins story with members of the Superman Squad<br /><br />What is astonishing about these stories, quite apart from their startling originality, is Morrison's profligacy in authoring them.  Each story has sufficient richness to lead easily to a 5 or 6 issue run.  So even though this volume collects only six issues, it has the same kind of content that you could expect in 25 or 30 issues.  Each story pretty much stands on its own.  There is a loose connection between some of them, but they don't require each other to any large degree (though knowing that in the first issue Superman has both undergone a dramatic increase in his powers, but at the cost that he is experiencing a cellular breakdown that will lead to his premature death does color each adventure).<br /><br />Because these stories are so rich and dense, this is one of those rare comics that repay several rereadings.  And I should add how delightful Frank Quitely's illustrations are.  His rendering of the most frequently drawn superhero in comic history is just as fresh as Morrison's stories.<br /><br />I've already put in my order for ALL STAR SUPERMAN 2, due this February.  Something to look forward to in the chilly days of winter.is just as fresh as Morrison's stories.    I've already put in my order for ALL STAR SUPERMAN 2, due this February.

Haven't read the whole thing yet but so far they seem to have their information down properly, though I am concerned about how accurate it really is, as in education wise, it seems up to standards but I'm just an amateur philosophy connoisseur, and the editors and writers don't have any PhD's from what I see so. Anyway the book explains certain pieces of philosophy and philosophers while comparing it to episodes and characters from south park. Of course this has nothing to do with Matt or Trey, as in they didn't make it so if you're looking for something like that it's not here.

Most of the books I've read lately have been focused on the church, on leadership, etc. House of Dark Shadows, fitting into a genre I wouldn't normally read, brought a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />The first book in the series \\""Dreamhouse Kings,\\"" the story centers on a boy named Xander (short for \\""Alexander\\"") and the experiences in which he and his family become entangled when they move into an old, odd house in the woods in a small town. I suppose it would fit into the \\""thriller\\"" category, but it's not a narrative that will make you scared to go to sleep at night. I was vaguely reminded of C. S. Lewis' The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe here and there, but it's certainly not a rip-off. And just as the Narnia books are rather easy to read, this one's an easy read, as well, but not so easy as to be insulting to the adult reader.<br /><br />The pacing was a bit slow toward the beginning of the book, although in retrospect the character development worked quite well this way. A few too many references to pop culture near the beginning made the tale feel a bit forced, but once I got into the story, there were several points at which I just couldn't put the book down. That's just one sign of a good book. I realized early on that it was likely intended for a teen/young adult audience, but that did nothing to diminish the experience. It was very cool to be so engrossed in a book that I didn't want to put it down.<br /><br />I was under the impression that Thomas Nelson published only Christian-based books, but I was apparently mistaken. If you're hunting for a fiction book that has a great moral and imparts some Christian ideas, this is not the book for you. This is simply a really good story of suspense and weirdness.<br /><br />I recommend it for some nice, leisurely reading.

This fact pertaining to the setting of the novel would have escaped me, had the very pretty cover of the book not pointed it out.  The truth is, I expected a novel that would transport me to Edwardian, turn of the last century England within the British Cotswolds, but instead I found a rather boring story, not much different than those that any parent would tell their children at bed time, and with no sense of ambience at all.<br /><br />The sleuth with paranormal abilities is Meredith Llewellyn, headmistress of Bellehaven Academy.  She is disturbed one Sunday when her friend and fellow professor Kathleen Duncan does not make it to Church.  As it will become evident quite soon, the reason Kathleen did not attend the services was because, quite simply, she's dead - murdered.  After having apparitions of the dead woman's ghost, Meredith takes it upon herself to inquire after her friend's demise, along with her two other friends and fellow professors, tomboy Felicity and primadonna Essie.<br /><br />The most important element in a mystery of this kind are the descriptions of historical setting, which in \\""High marks for murder\\"" are simply lacking.  There are no period words to describe the vehicle of transport of the time, i.e. the horse and carriage, such as the \\""fiacre\\"", or the \\""plangent tones of the evensong\\"" when attending mass.  Moreover, the dialogue is dull, with the exception of one scene close to the end of the novel; and the set up for the sequel at the end of the novel is also dull and uninteresting.  I would also have appreciated more detailed descriptions of the school and the mechanics of the classes, etc, as I find mysteries should be not only entertaining but enlightening as well.","2008-12-17","2008","Books"

""I Don't Know But We Gotta Go.""","\\""On the Road\\"" is based on events that happened on author Jack Kerouac's journeys across America from 1947 to 1950.  These stories of travel, searching, and exploration provide a window into mid-century Beat culture and have been read for decades.<br /><br />Kerouac's keen travel observations provide the present-day reader with insights into what the country was like two or three generations ago and some of the ways it differs from America today.  America seemed more free and wide-open in these pages, but the book is a reminder of how the encroachments of centralization and bureaucracy are on ongoing process--one of the characters in \\""On the Road\\"" laments how much less free the country was at the book's mid-century vantage point than it was in the years before World War I.<br /><br />Jazz was still wildly popular in America in the 1940s, and Kerouac references it constantly in these pages.  Less savory aspects of the Beat culture included indiscriminate sexual activity, drug use, and alcohol abuse, and the repetitive nature of the stories describing these activities suggests that the characters were searching for something and just not finding it.  Not all of the tales in the book were seedy, though, with many just plain fun travel stories.<br /><br />In spots the repetitiveness did get tiresome, as did some of the eye-rolling driving techniques that suggested that the characters were just overgrown delinquents, but readers who have always been curious about the book and want to examine the Beat culture will find much of interest in \\""On the Road.\\""","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

Readers cannot help learn at least some degree of empathy with all living things; they learn without effort what it is like to be a scientist - that is, that there is a whole life pattern behind any little creature, to be discovered.    It is said that kids who speak two languages in childhood become smarter because of that: I imagine it's because concept (e.g. \\""table\\"") and a given language's word for it are not fused together, but necessarily separate.  I bet these books have a similar effect: they teach a pattern of empathy, and introduce a habit of assuming there is a rich and interesting story behind every little thing.  And that there are some constant questions to ask: where do they get their energy (food) and how does their life develop, etc.  If I were a cognitive scientist I would want to do research to see if they aren't a new and interesting \\""genre\\"" of children's book.","2008-12-17","2008","Books"

He begins planning his usual family holiday dinner in great detail when his grandfather interrupts with disheartening news: \\""This year, the entire Stilton family will spend Christmas in New York!\\"" Grandfather, it seems, has accepted an invitation to spend Christmas in his friend's fabulous apartment overlooking Central Park. Geronimo, ever the traditionalist, protests --- but to no avail. And when Geronimo hears how excited his nephew Benjamin is, he fakes enthusiasm.    His flight to New York goes fairly smoothly (at least, for nontraveler Geronimo!). It's not until he's in the taxi on his way to the MacMouse apartment that Geronimo runs into a huge problem. He discovers that his wallet is in his suitcase...and he has the wrong suitcase! He accidentally grabbed an identical bag belonging to someone else at the airport. Geronimo doesn't have money or his cell phone, but he does discover a tag on the bag that reads \\""Mrs. A. Smith.\\"" He panics. Smith must be the most common name in the world! How will he ever find the bag's owner and trade her for his own suitcase?    When Geronimo discovers Mrs. Smith's appointment book, he decides he will find her. The first entry for that day is \\""10:00 Columbia University,\\"" so he takes off on foot on a tremendous quest that leads him all over the Big Apple. Geronimo's treasure hunt through the city gives A VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS a great plot --- plus oodles of fascinating information about New York City, along with many fun Christmas ideas.    --- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon (terryms2001@yahoo.com)","2008-12-17","2008","Books"

Don has written the book with the military in mind but, as he will tell you himself, this book will assist any organization, Law Enforcement, Security, or any other corporation looking to to select the right people , the right leaders for the job, those with strength of character who, create and nurture the right cohesive environment to making timely and executable decisions based  on;  knowledge, continued learning and evolution as well as the use of new incoming explicit and implicit information in changing conditions allowing for, adaptability and individual initiative , which leads to Getting Jobs Done!     The book has great lessons and discussions about the history and evolution of warfare from the 1st generation to 4GW and gives examples, that make  important distinctions easier to understand and translate to various professions. It also has historic lessons on training methods from the industrial age top/down methods of Taylor and Descartes to the Bottom/Up approach of Deming who insisted that the lowest level workers be empowered to decide and act!  Manning the Future Legions also discusses the theories of COL John Boyd and other modern strategist who know how to translate theory into practice.     These ideas combined with Vandergriff's own innovative ideas and insights based on his experience at reshaping the Army methodology of training and leadership, make this book an outstanding resource for any organization whose mission it is to be more productive through cohesive efforts. Vandergriff's ideas on human and organizational development are laid out in this book and are easy to understand, but make nomistake will take strength of character and effort to implement. However, Well worth the effort!    The world has changed and hence the threats and problems we face and have to deal with have changed as well. This leads tot he premise of the book; changing the culture and climate in organizations to that of Bottom Up Decision Making or decision making on the frontline so time critical decisions are made and actions taken to achieve results.      Manning the Future Legions of the United States Finding and Developing Tomorrows Centurions is a adaptive blueprint to getting it done.     Outstanding read!

These are enhanced by Johnson's own experiences.    Although there is a lot of good material in this book, the organization is a bit haphazard, and the book has numerous typos, leading the reader to believe it may have been put together hastily. The author's experiences could also have been supplemented with other people's, giving a broader view on the subjects covered.    If this is the first book you've read on discovering your own power to manifest your life, it provides a basic framework that will encourage further reading. If you're already fluent in these studies, this book will give you only one person's experiences in following these principles successfully. The inspirational stories will leave you feeling good about life, eager to create positive changes for yourself.    Reviewer: Alice Berger, Bergers Book Reviews","2008-12-17","2008","Books"

There are two reviews of it under what Amazon is pleased to call \\""The Spanish Edition\\"" but which are obviously NOT reviews of the Spanish edition. ---How anyone could make a translation of this book into any language is beyond me.  It's already a translation to read the old Berkshire and Cornish dialects of some of the chapters and try to make any sense of them at all.  But we'll let that be.<br /><br />So, what we have here is a series of accounts regarding happenings of the fictional town of Ulverton in the south of England from the end of the English Civil War until 1988, under different guises by men and women of varying levels of education and social position.  Be forewarned that, like the law clerk taking depositions in the chapter entitled, ahem, Deposition, you will be in need of some sort of translator to get the full import of what is being said, particularly in the chapter entitled Stitches, which is well-nigh past understanding in parts.  But you need not go to such efforts as the author did, such as digging out \\""A Glossary of Berkshire Words & Phrases\\"" (London, 1880) to suss it all out.  The general import comes through and what doesn't is made manifest in later, more articulate chapters.<br /><br />The value of this book, what it conveyed most fully to me, lies in the history of different mind-sets, of ways of seeing the world, of valuations placed on earth, man and machine varying with the circumstances of the storyteller in each chapter and the times and milieu in which he or she lives.  The prose is as rich and loamy as the earth of Ulverton, so often described here in so many ways.<br /><br />The book makes a claim, a justified one, at being a work of art.  But this can cut two ways.  It thus must be judged by the exacting standards that obtain to such an enterprise.  And, for this reader, it fell a bit short by these standards.  It is, especially towards the end, more artsy than it is a work of art.  It bellows out \\""WORK OF ART\\"" a bit too raucously for my ear.<br /><br />But, for all that, it is an enchanting, enthralling, demanding book well worth the deep reader's while.  In \\""Treasure,\\"" my favourite chapter, Thorpe lays out what might well be regarded his manifesto for writing this book, under the guise of another voice, the voice of a man lured to dig into the ancient barrow on the edge of Ulverton (I can't help but mention that Tolkien readers will be all too familiar with the superstitions regarding dreaded barrow wights.):<br /><br />\\""For I had come to involve myself in this local adventure, this delving back into memories safely other than my own, and decidedly older, in a spirit of retreat from more pressing demands on my soul.  This is probably true of the majority of our actions, but whether this blights them in some way - well, this is not a work of moral philosophy.\\""<br /><br />Indeed, most thankfully, it is not!s out \\""WORK OF ART\\"" a bit too raucously for my ear.

This is yet another example of his wonderful story telling ability. Before I read his first book Brood X, I would have told you I did not like horror stories. But he has made me rethink that statement. If MPC writes it I will read it. It is just that simple.<br /><br />Wes Rockville, a disgraced law enforcement agent, is given one last chance to prove himself and save his career when he's reassigned to a 232 year old secret government organization. The Witches Protection Program. His first assignment: uncover a billion-dollar Cosmetics company’s diabolical plan of using witchcraft for global domination, while protecting its heiress Morgan Pendragon from her aunt’s evil deeds. Reluctantly paired with veteran witch protector, Alastair Verne, Wes must learn to believe in both witches and himself. Filled with adventure, suspense and a rousing good time, Michael Phillip Cash creates a tongue-in-cheek alternate reality where witches cast spells and wreak havoc in modern day New York City.<br />Witches Protection Program opens with a scene you might read in any crime/ police story. Someone messed up and now has to take an assignment that he doesn't want. And that is where normal and run of the mill stop and you step in to the wondrous world of MPC's mind.<br /><br />Two kinds of witches, Davina's and Willa's. Hiding in plain sight and running amok.

I can’t imagine its lying on a coffee table without starting a delightful conversation.<br />Rowdy is also a delight to read. Once I started it, I couldn't put it down. Madsen buys a vintage sail boat in 1998 and vows to restore it to its original 1916 condition. He spends a great deal of time and money on the project over the next several years but eventually gets the job done.<br /><br />He also becomes deeply interested in the boat's history. A visit from the 93-year-old daughter of the original owner, Holland Duell, leads to startling discoveries. Among other things, Duell is a descendant of the person who fired &#34;the shot heard around the world&#34; at Concord beginning the American Revolution. Duell himself, as the commander of an artillery battalion in the final weeks of the First World War, led the charge that punched a hole in the Germans' formerly impregnable defensive line and brought the war to an end. Many other colorful characters fill this book, from the White House of Theodore Roosevelt to the Hollywood of Lillian Gish.<br /><br />I'm grateful to Madsen for pulling me into Rowdy's worlds, especially those of sail boating and sail-boat racing, of early-twentieth-century high-society &#34;blue blood&#34; Republican New York, of Yankees in the rain and mud of France finally putting an end to the Great War in Europe, and of the early days of Hollywood and genteel producers lavishing borrowed money on the films of the actresses they fall in love with. I enjoyed it all, even at the very end the tale of the luckless but fun-loving family who sail a battered Rowdy from the east coast to the west through the Panama Canal amid rioting in the 1960s.<br /><br />The Association of Independent Authors gave me this book, which it received from Madsen, in return for my honest opinion as to whether Rowdy deserved the group’s Clemens Medal. I was pleased to learn that the Association of Independent Authors subsequently awarded its Clemens Medal to Rowdy.thors subsequently awarded its Clemens Medal to Rowdy.","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

Anyone???","Let me first start off by saying that I do like this book because it takes all of those little known facts about health and wellness and collaborates them into one very easy to read book. Note that I did say \\""known\\"" facts. If you've had the equivalent of a middle school health class, this will not be new to you (well may be the chapter on erectile dysfunction). That being said, it doesn't discount the fact that this is important information about wellness and is a good review.    Many times when we make an appointment with our MD, it is because we have an ailment of some sort that we would like resolved. Most people don't call to make an appointment to come in and talk about wellness. When we do visit the MD, they typically do not have an infinite amount of time to discuss diet, exercise, stress and libido on top of the 10 minutes that they blocked off to work up the left ear pain that you came in for. I like this book because it does encompass all of the health and wellness aspects that our primary care provider should discuss at the bedside... if they had the time. It is written in the voice of the author as if she is having a conversation with you or telling you about herself.    The author also gives very easy to understand explanations of medical problems such as why high blood pressure is bad for your body (in lay terms) as well as other risk factors for certain morbidities and recommendations for health screenings.  In the chapter on diet, the author mentioned that she would be putting some sample, healthy menus at the end of the book. I was excited with anticipation to see what she had put together. I especially thought that the chapter on suppliments was a little cumbersome to get through and was hoping that her sample menus would incorporate the idea of obtaining our daily nutritional needs through food, kind of pulling that chapter together and showing examples of how to eat a variety of healthy foods and possibly avoid suppliments in the form of pills. Unfortunately, I was sadly disappointed when there was a sample for merely 1 day worth of meals at the end of the book. REALLY?... One whole day worth?   One final comment that I would like to make is that throughout the book and in the chapter on exercise, the author encourages you to go to her HUSBAND'S website and consider his Backyard Workout. So, I did what the doctor ordered and took a look, thinking that it, too, would have a sample workout (like the above mentioned sample menus). Well, this workout is something that you PURCHASE.... for a list price of one hundred and ninety-nine dollars (of course that price is crossed out and set up like all of those must have, cure all sales pitch websites). No joke!  Would I recommend this book? Yes. If you follow the 21 chapters in the book, you definately will lead a healthy lifestyle. They are by no means \\""secrets\\"", though. With the New Year fast approaching, now is the perfect time to refresh on this informtion and add more quality days to your life.","2008-12-17","2008","Books"

During Stalin's Soviet Russia of the 1930s, the rational and scientific take absolute preference over the intuitive and metaphysical, vast mechanisms are in place to hush up anything extraordinary or inexplicable, and aberrant citizens disappear mysteriously on a daily basis. What better place for Satan and his ministers to wreak supernatural havoc?     The first half of the novel is dizzying and delirious, depicting the wickedly humorous exploits of the devil--in the guise of Woland, a black magician--and his unholy companions through the eyes of several average Russian characters. The second half zooms in on the title charcters, a sort of reversal of the Faust lovers, with young, beautiful Margarita seeking Satan's help to reunite her with her lover, a perscecuted novelist. Woven throughout the crazily uneven events of the main story are excerpts from the \\""Master's\\"" novel manuscript, a demythologizing of the Pontius Pilate story.     A terrific, extremely readable Russian masterpiece. Highly recommended.","2008-12-17","2008","Books"

I got halfway through Part II and decided that enough was enough. I agree with other reviewers, the few wilderness descriptions were very well done but the plot and characters were so poorly developed and so very predictable that the whole novel fell through.

I found this book very readable, and Christensen's understanding of the issues, along with his even-handed presentation of the pressures faced by the U.S in terms of international security and global governance juxtaposed against the challenges faced by China as a rising power (dealing with the issues of a developing country), effectively illustrates the importance of smart diplomacy vs alarmist theories about China's rise. It is refreshing to have these issues demystified by someone without a political agenda, who can praise the merits and weaknesses of all of the past few U.S. administrations, regardless of their political affiliations. We can hope the lessons learned will be reflected in our diplomacy going forward.","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

When compared to other developed democracies, the United States is the leader in sending it's populace to jail.    In Bruce Western's Punishment and Inequality in America, he manages to shed light on just how serious the effects of mass incarceration are on our society.  Throughout his book Western provides quantitative data to support his notion that mass incarceration exacerbates inequality within the United States.         He goes on to establish that incarceration can be perceived as an institutional membership for many African American males, successfully pushing the poor black minority further into a desperate standard of living which is ripe for recidivism and shattered family structures. As he states, \\""Black men under age forty have an incarceration rate of 11.5 percent, and are just as likely to be in prison or jail as in a labor union, and about twice as likely to be incarcerated, as to receive government benefits\\""(p. 19).  For many black men in this country, it is common to know someone that has been incarcerated or have actually been incarcerated personally.         Western partially blames the \\""law and order themes\\"" of the Republican Party for the increased punitive stance.  According to Western, after the civil rights movement, there were \\""realigned race relations,\\"" coupled with \\""elevated crime rates,\\"" that led many in the Republican Party to push their get tough agendas.  He points out presidents such as Nixon, Reagan, and Bush Senior all enacted more punitive crime measures.  Western, however, lacks a more direct example of the actual effects of each presidential administration.  It would be interesting to see how each Republican presidency contributed to the prison boom; it would also better support his political argument.  No doubt each Republican administration had an effect on the state of incarceration in this country, but which one had the most serious impactis not clearly revealed.      Western concludes his book by pointing out that the prison boom had little effect on the national drop in crime rates, though provides little suggestions for alternatives.  Overall it was an informative book that brings needed attention to a controversial topic affecting millions of lives.","2008-12-17","2008","Books"

By all accounts his life was on track and he was achieving the American dream - a good family, interesting job and a good status in life by all standars.  Yet as an avid fan of biographies there was something missing for me - maybe some compelling twist or a compelling, unexpected response of the author to his life trials.

The narrative sucks you right into the mindset of a speculator as trades go wrong, right, and then wrong again.  Along the way, you get a tour of the turn-of-the-century brokerage world, a glimpse into the commodity markets, and a chance to meet an incredibly well-drawn cast of characters based on real-life figures who shaped the way our markets work today.<br /><br />My favorite of these characters is Mr. Partridge, who teaches the trader that no matter what, in a bull market, he will not part with his stock positions.  His conviction is unshakable when implored by a tipster to part with his shares.  His response is something along the lines of \\""I can't afford to sell my stock, as we are in a bull market.\\""<br /><br />What Mr. Partridge is really saying is that, yes, maybe the tipster is correct that the stock is about to drop, but reacting to this minor fluctuation by selling could cause him to miss the broader trend of the market, which is higher.  Mr. Partridge explains that his market education came through many booms and panics and at a high price, and so he couldn't possibly afford to throw that education out the window by losing his position in a bull market.<br /><br />As simplistic as this philosophy is, I am amazed at how often I see it disregarded here on The Street (and in my own trading!)<br /><br />I recommend Reminiscences of a Stock Operator to anyone who has an interest in trading, investing, speculation or the history of the  commodities and stock markets.  I am amazed that this book has not yet been made into a movie, although Hollywood would probably move it into a modern day setting, add a love interest and leave out all the interesting market mechanics that make the book so valuable.<br /><br />On second thought, read it now and pray that the film rights never get picked up...and ignore the words of Mr. Partridge at your own peril!<br /><br />The Reformed Broker<br />[...]ets.

There is no way of knowing whether one’s neighbor is spying for the government, or what one’s supposed friend will say under pressure to a State Security agent. A loyal Party member might be imprisoned or executed as quickly as a traitor; innocence means nothing for a person caught in a government trap.<br /><br />But there are larger terrors, too. When a little boy is murdered at the cinema where his aunt works, the ensuing investigation sheds a little too much light on the personal lives of the cinema’s female ushers, each of whom is hiding a dark secret of her own.<br /><br />Nearly lost to censorship, this rediscovered gem of Czech literature depicts a chilling moment in history, redolent with the stifling atmosphere of political and personal oppression of the early days of Communist Czechoslovakia.<br /><br />From the title of the book, it is very clear that the book is divided into two parts- Innocence and Murder on Steep Street. Well, but from the synopsis, it sounds like a murder/espionage style of thriller, although that's the half of it. The larger picture of the story lies in the 1950s Prague especially the period when Prague was under the Communist rule when marking anyone, who goes beyond the government by either speaking evil in the name of government or participating in any ploy against the government or even if you have not done anything, as &#34;dissident&#34; and by punishing them by putting them on life imprisonment. The author, herself, was a victim of this era, and telling this personal story brings alive those gruesome vivid details of the period with a sharp, raw voice in this part-thriller-part-historical-fiction novel.<br /><br />So while reading especially while reviewing this book, please do not take this book as a mystery novel even for a single bit, since it doesn't only contain a mystery that unravels in an nontraditional manner but also it is hidden under multiple layers of history, which is indirectly proportional to the murder mystery.<br /><br />Helena Nov&aacute;kov&aacute; gets a job as an usher at the Horizon Cinema in Prague, when her husband was imprisoned for espionage. Helena too herself is under suspicion and the government put spies around her to keep eyes on her activities. Helena is ripped apart by the choices of whether to save the life of her beloved by risking hers or whether to let go. The first half of the story tells the readers about how innocent lives were torn apart by the Communist government, how each one fought against not will against the government but also against their souls to protect themselves from the government who terrorized the whole nation. The insightful picture that the author sketched during this period of Communist Prague is of the want of freedom against the victimization towards mortality without guilt.<br /><br />The second half opens with the murder followed by a drastic change of narrative from first person POV of Helena to third person POV of other key characters while Helena takes the back seat. This time the author narrated about the murder where the victim is an unidentified person, I mean the author deliberately kept the identity under wrap and since the murder took place right in front of the Horizon Cinema, all the employees are under the probable suspect list. This part sees the entry of yet another brilliant character of this book, Vendyš, a police detective who too being honest, is a victim of political corruption and tyranny of this communist government.<br /><br />The story from the second half takes an 180 degree turn of being stead to being fast paced and the way the author teased her readers with the mystery by throwing little hints and turns at the beginning to totally throwing the readers off their edges by introducing unexpected twists, definitely puts the book into an intriguing page turner category. The writing style is one of a kind- purely honest and sheerly engaging. The story builds up like a maze- when the reader thinks he found the way, is actually the time when he falls deeper into this mystical puzzle.<br /><br />The book has this much amount of unexpected hidden twists and turns that it is enough to kill the readers with anticipation. The author never once openly or positively talked about the mystery, since she keeps on introducing one new suspect after another and the way she addresses each one of them is another complex thing that urges the readers many a times to look what they read before one particular chapter. The book feels like walking in the mist, you can see the light yet you can't reach it without proper direction.<br /><br />Although for die-hard thriller fans, the climax might come as a disappointing shock since the author wrapped it up in a rather different way than it happens in a regular thriller novel. So be prepared for the climax- not something too satisfying yet something that completely justifies the overall story.<br /><br />The timeline as well as the backdrop is surprisingly very striking. Since the story is a personal one, so each and every details comes alive in this book since the author had portrayed the backdrop in an intricate fashion and it also seems like she had an eye for tiniest of tiny details that finally reproduces a brilliant background for this story. Teleport would be the wrong word to describe how I felt while reading this novel, instead I would stress on the fact that I was instantly time traveled to yet another remarkable yet painful era in our history in a completely different yet beautiful land called Prague.<br /><br />This novel is a brilliant example of something very challenging that engages each and every brain cells of the readers to contemplate in their own way and also of something which is thoroughly insightful enough to show the readers a dark picture of the reality as well as of the human souls.<br /><br />Verdict: In one word, a must read, only if you can handle complexities and multi layers in a plot.he entry of yet another brilliant character of this book, Vendyš, a police detective who too being honest, is a victim of political corruption and tyranny of this communist government.<br /><br />The story from the second half takes an 180 degree turn of being stead to being fast paced and the way the author teased her readers with the mystery by throwing little hints and turns at the beginning to totally throwing the readers off their edges by introducing unexpected twists, definitely puts the book into an intriguing page turner category.

Nevertheless, it should be required reading for all members of congress, the president and the candidates for President of the U.S. and all officials of the EU and their individual members of parliament.  This book is not for the average reader though as it will either put you to sleep or go over your head with economic and financial theory and practice.  However, I believe, we as a nation, should implement some of his remedies immediately.  But, the euro needs to depart the scene.  I agree with Mr. Wolf, that we need higher capital requirements and less regulation on banks (exit Dodd frank and sarbanes oxley and the Volker rule).  According to Mr. Wolf the Volker rule cannot be implemented.  Banks and insurance companies should not be permitted to possess a leverage above 10:1.  On page 252 are the five questions to ask regarding regulations of business and banks.  We cannot go back to the gold standard(pg 343).  We have not yet solved the financial crisis.  Tax reform is needed NOW more than ever.  Corporate compensation packages need to emphasize long term horizons rather than short term gains.  We cannot depend on rating agencies to properly evaluate assets.<br />  The world is not going back to a 19th century free market.  That type of limited government is not acceptable to universal sufferage democracies of the 21st century, even if one believed it desirable.  [Which Wolf does not].  In Wolf's opinion, provision of social insurance and public consumption is a legitimate function of a wealthy [21st century] state.  I will support part of that notion, but not all.  The economic, financial, intellectual, and political elites misunderstood the consequences of financial liberalization. The policy-making elite failed to appreciate the risks of a systemic breakdown.  The political economy of capitalism requires a belief that success is earned, not stolen, or handed to the players by insiders in business or government.  The loss of confidence in the competence and probity and honesty of elites reduces trust in democratic legitimacy.  People believe the country is not being governed in their best long term interest , but for a narrow segment of well-connected insiders who reap most of the gains and, when things go wrong, are not just shielded from loss but impose massive costs on everybody else.  This creates outraged populations on both the right and the left.  The losses of the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-9 will take a decade or more to recover from in the U.S.A.  Longer in other countries.pg 350-353.","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

There are some jumps in the character’s time line even though the book is over 400 pages.

Phillips wrote a book called Your God is Too Small. In it he urged Christians to not put God in a box, but try to see him as he really is, in all his grandeur, majesty and magnificence.  God is far bigger than our limited understanding of him.<br /><br />And C.S. Lewis spoke about God as the `great iconoclast\\"". He is forever having to shatter our icons, our false pictures about Himself. We have distorted images of who God is. So God in his mercy has to break all the false and limiting understandings we have of who he really is.<br /><br />In a similar vein, Kendall here writes about a disturbing trend in the church: the tendency to reduce God to a likeable, nice buddy and pal. He is a safe and domesticated God who will not want to upset us or challenge us. He is more of a celestial mate who exists to keep us happy, than the awesome God of the universe that demands our obedience and reverence.<br /><br />Thus the subtitle of this book: Is Your God Too Nice? Kendall argues that most of us want a nice God, a tame God, an inoffensive God, a non-demanding God, a likable God and an easy-to-get-along-with God. But the real God of the universe is not necessarily any of these things.<br /><br />Indeed, we \\""are embarrassed about the God of the Bible, especially the God of the Old Testament,\\"" says Kendall, and \\""even the teachings of Jesus and the apostles when it comes to the need and the only way to be saved, God's right to judge and (last but not least) hell.\\""<br /><br />These can all be uncomfortable doctrines for some Christians, so we have a habit of glossing them over, or denying them altogether. The truth is, we want a nice God, a manageable God, and a tame God. And we certainly do not want to offend others, to rock the boat, or to appear to be too radical or divisive.<br /><br />All of which means we have put God in a box and made him in our own image. Kendall says we must stop \\""apologizing for God\\"" and \\""give up trying to make him look appealing\\"". Only by upholding the real God of the Bible will we bring honour to him and make a difference in this world. But the Nice God \\""is not big enough, strong enough, awesome enough or knowledgeable enough to hurt a fly\\"".<br /><br />We have de-stigmatised the Christian message, watered down the claims of God, and taken the offence out of Gospel. But if we will be true to God and his Word, then we must be willing to get out of our comfort zones, and suffer with Jesus outside the camp, bearing his disgrace, as Hebrews 13:13 says.<br /><br />Kendall mentions various ways in which we will need to step out of our comfort zones. One is to be willing to be made a fool for Christ's sake. It means being willing to do what our Lord asks of us, even if it means we end up receiving all the world's ridicule, derision and scorn.<br /><br />As Paul reminds us in 1 Cor. 1, God chooses to use the weak, foolish and lowly things of the world to get his job done. Unless we are willing to humble ourselves and identify with our Lord in his shame and disgrace, we will not be effective for him.<br /><br />Certain doctrines must also be reclaimed. The fear of the Lord is one of them. This doctrine is emphasised throughout Scripture. But we have managed to water it down and anesthetise it. We say that the fear of the Lord really means just having awe and reverence. It does mean that, but much more as well.<br /><br />As Kendall notes, the fear of God is a very serious matter in Scripture. The God with whom we have to do is not to be trivialised and made safe. He is a consuming fire. And when we are told to fear God, often that means just that - to fear God.<br /><br />For example, the same word is used in Matt. 1:20, when an angel tells Joseph not to fear taking Mary as a wife. Surely this does not mean, \\""Do not be in awe\\"". It means do not be afraid. The same term is used of how we should approach God. A bit of holy fear would do us all a lot of good.<br /><br />Sure, we are reconciled to God because of what Jesus did, but that does not mean God becomes some safe, tame and nice cosmic grandfather. Kendall points out the many passages in the Gospels and Acts where we read of the disciples being filled with great fear. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.<br /><br />In many other ways Kendall urges us to get out of our comfort zones and let God be God. We have for too long settled for a domesticated and humanised God. As Lucy had to be reminded in the Lewis Narnia stories, Aslan (the Christ figure) is not to be trifled with.<br /><br />Lucy asks if Aslan is safe. She is answered with these words: \\""`Course he isn't safe. But he's good. He's the King, I tell you\\"". While we can all have a personal love relationship with God through Christ, we still remain humans, and he still remains God. We always need to keep this truth in mind.<br /><br />Kendall has done a good job of reminding us that God is God, and he will not be brought down to our level. Indeed, what God wants is to bring us up to his level. But we come to him on his terms, not ours. This book is a good reminder of these truths. We do not need a nice God. We need the God of Scripture and him alone.Kendall points out the many passages in the Gospels and Acts where we read of the disciples being filled with great fear.

Once at Grey's Maine estate, Brandy is attracted to Grey (there's a surprise), as well as his bit of a rake younger brother.<br /><br />As Missy comes out of her shadows during the daytime, Brandy experiences some strange activities in her room during the night (is it the child who becomes a different person at night or are other forces at play?), as well as one too many too close calls that threaten her life.

The book's documentation shows:         1) The Roman Fathers (who are often quoted for their teaching of eternal punishment) represent the tiniest minority of Christians at the start of the faith.         2) The overwhelming vast majority of original Christians were taught universal salvation - not just in church but also in the earliest theological schools as well.          3) Almost overnight, mainstream Christianity shifted from belief in universal salvation to belief in the Roman doctrine of eternal punishment in hell.          4) The book then reveals the historical events which led to this sudden and instantaneous shift.  (The historical revelation is not only fascinating, but it also has profound implications for the Christian faith today.)    This book blows the lid off a dirty little secret behind the development of a core Christian belief.  And it reveals the surprising differences between the original Bible penned by the apostles and the modern versions read in churches today.      In my opinion, the Christian faith is very well served in the overall conclusion of the book. Despite the uncensored depiction of the raw historical truth, the book remains pro-Christian, pro-Bible in its final analysis.      I strongly recommend this book for Christians and non-Christians alike.  A fascinating read regardless of your religious persuasion.","2008-12-17","2008","Books"

Adventurous Women is a wonderful way to introduce young people to qualities like perseverance, courage, boldness, equanimity, and persistence - all part of an adventuresome spirit.  I've given this book to my niece and her family; all thoroughly enjoyed the selection of women featured.  They said they learned more about women they were familiar with and were introduced to pioneers they had never heard of before.  I've given this book to teacher colleagues (they always report that there are not enough women's history materials to support their teaching) and they've used it in their social studies classes as well as in writing lessons.  These teachers say their students enjoy the biographical portraits and the students use the essays as models for their own writing.

The down side to this book is that for flower variations, you are asked to flip to other pages for some/additional instructions. It would have been great if all the instructions were in one place. The book also doesn't have an illustrated step by step instruction which is a bit difficult for beginners like me.

Spring has come to Winter Break after a lingering winter. On hand again are the same delightful town characters, and Ivy's Bygone Bookstore is in the black. Her life is back on track. And with the first thrall of Spring, Ivy is beginning to think she might be in love with childhood friend turned Deputy Sheriff, Amos Parker. Will their budding romance survive Ivy's latest investigation and the unexpected arrival of her parents in Winter Break?<br /><br />When Ivy discovers a map hidden in an old music box, the legend of gambler's gold resurfaces. The legend of hidden gold has been a topic of interest in Winter Break for more than a century. Does the faded map represent hidden gold, or something far more sinister? Ivy simply has to know, of course, despite Amos's warnings and concerns. Mehl scatters enticing hints for readers to relish as Ivy investigates and the plot thickens. Someone tries to burn down the bookstore. Who and why? The arrival of Ivy's parents -- especially her mother -- complicates an already difficult situation. Why did her missionary parents suddenly leave China and head for Winter Break? Helping Ivy dig for answers is entertaining, and great fun.<br /><br />Mehl's plot and character development makes for a satisfying read. Even the brief appearance by a passing character becomes memorable and adds an interesting dimension to the story when Nancy Mehl spins a tale. Winter Break resident, Mavis Baumgartner, is the perfect example:<br /><br />\\""Mavis Baumgartner was a force to be reckoned with, and she ran her family like a drill sergeant cursed with an unruly command. Although all our volunteers had been given firefighters' outfits by the Stevens County Fire Department, only the men had them on. Mavis was so massive she couldn't fit into hers. Instead, she wore a big, bright yellow rain poncho over her long flannel nightgown. As she clomped around in enormous black rubber boots, with her poncho flapping in the breeze and her overly bleached bun beginning to come loose from the hairpins that were trying valiantly to keep it secure, she looked like Big Bird with an attitude and a bad dye job.\\""<br /><br />We have two more books remaining in the Ivy Towers mystery series. Readers who enjoy cozy mysteries with intriguing plots and delightful characters won't want to miss even one book in this series. Ivy Towers and the gang from Winter Break will be back soon in book three, For Whom the Wedding Bell Tolls. I wonder if Ivy gets married in this one or if that tolling bell signifies a mystery? We'll have to read the book to find out.flapping in the breeze and her overly bleached bun beginning to come loose from the hairpins that were trying valiantly to keep it secure, she looked like Big Bird with an attitude and a bad dye job.\\""    We have two more books remaining in the Ivy Towers mystery series.

I've encouraged my son (11) to read the books as vampires and werewolves are right up his alley and so far he is finishing Eclipse and rounding third to New Moon.  Then I started reading Breaking Dawn...what the heck happened?!  First, the fourth book is NOTHING like the first three.  It is almost as if she was writing a totally different story.  The names are the same but they are not the same people.  What made the characters interesting is non-existent in this book.  This story is not romantic and it doesn't have that \\""pull\\"" that the first three books had.  Second, I saw an interview with the author where they make a point that the characters did not have sex - well, that changes soon in the fourth book.  I am no shrew, but there were times where I was even shocked and amazed at what was going on.  Bruises?!  Breaking headboards?!  Pregnancy?!  WTF?!  At this point I am trying to come up with a way to tell my son that after reading the first three books he won't be able to read the fourth book until he is 18.  I am warning all of my friends not to let their kids read this book.  Not only does it not seem to fit in with the theme and undertone of the series - which is the Romeo & Juliette-esque theme of forbidden love - but it was completely irresponsible of the author, knowing her fan base is mostly comprised of teenage girls, to wrap up teenage sex, marriage and motherhood in this bright shiny red candy-like wrapper and serve it up to inocent little minds like it was a lollipop.  Even Bella being turned into a vampire was nothing - none of the terrible things that happened to the other vampires when they \\""changed\\"" happened to her.  The author might as well have stuck a crack pipe in her mouth and showed that smoking crack doesn't really hurt you, either!  This book upset me on so many levels.  And not only did it shock me and upset me, it didn't even entertain me while doing it.  What was she thinking?!","2008-12-17","2008","Books"

This is actually the 2nd book in a series - if I had known that, I might have selected something else to read and review, but I'm actually glad I didn't, because this quirky, campy little town has oozed itself into my brain now.<br /><br />The story revolves around a new kid in town - Duke Sherrad, who tells fortunes and is ardently seeking to date Daisy Giordano.  Daisy at first is skeptical about Duke's psychic power, but when a teacher - the subject of one of Duke's predictions - winds up dead, she takes a closer look.  She decides to - with the occasional help of her sisters - try to track down the murderer.  The problem is that one of her sisters is dating a prominent werewolf in the community, and all the signs point to this killing being done by a werewolf.  Can Daisy find the answer in time?<br /><br />With its wry sense of humour and enticingly bizarre settings, this book might be just what you need to get your young adults reading rather than watching the tube.  Definitely check it out.  You better believe I'm going to track down the first book in this most engaging series.","2008-12-18","2008","Books"

A lot of times we choose the less ethical route, and try to justify our decision with excuses like, nobody is getting hurt, or it's not illegal, or the end justify the means, etc.  And even though we know that those unethical behavior is not right but we did it anyway. One thing lead to another (of unethical decisions), soon it will become a habit and negatively impact our character and life.<br /><br />Most people (if not everyone) have lied or act unethically in their life and most likely will do so again in the future, but each of us have the power to choose whether we want to be ethical.<br />If you want to be more ethical but not sure what to do or where to start, then Ethics for the Real World is a great start.<br /><br />This book isn't about telling us what is right or wrong (The author leaves this task for us), but it is about how to create our own rule (personal code/philosophy) and then implement strategies in order to be able to apply (and stick) to those rule in our work and personal life.<br /><br />The core message of this book is the following:<br />In order for us to become a skillful ethical decision makers, we need to:<br />1. Master ethical distinction to enable clear ethical thinking<br />2. Commit in advance to ethical principles<br />3. Exercise disciplined decision-making skills to choose wisely<br /><br />What I like about this book:<br />1. Practical (simple concept and instruction)<br />2. A lot of real-life (and relevant) example of situations<br />3. Tips on how we can make ethical choice a habit<br />4. Serve as a framework rather just telling us what is right or wrong<br />5. Help us identify potential issues (makes us more aware)<br /><br />I think ethics is similar to integrity. It is about doing the right thing even when nobody is watching.<br />Even though ethics should be be common sense, I think this topic/book should be explicitly taught in school (business school etc).<br /><br />All the best in your effort to be more ethical and lead a happier life,<br /><br />Sidarta Tanube more ethical and lead a happier life,    Sidarta Tanu","2008-12-18","2008","Books"

In this action packed, puzzle filled book, The Mysterious Benedict Society and the Perilous Journey by Trenton Lee Stewart, the society is having their one year reunion. The 2 boys: Renyie Muldoon (11) and Sticky `George' Washington (11), and 2 girls: Kate Wetherall (12) and Constance Contraire (3) rush to Mr. Benedict's house for their one year reunion party, as promised, a scavenger hunt was created by Benedict. When they arrive they find that in Mr. Benedict and his `right hand women,' Number Two, have been replaced with a ransom note! Mr. Benedict and Number Two have been kidnapped by Benedict's evil twin brother Ledroptha Curtain. The children disobey their loved ones and set off to find their close friends, running into many old enemies and some new ones. `The Ten Men' -they have 10 different ways of harming you and each man is equivalent to 10 men- are dressed like normal businessmen, but have super business utensils; example: a pencil as a dart, and a calculator as a bomb. Suspecting that Benedict and Number Two would be close to where his original clues were, the children follow the clues around the world. Dangers, puzzles and mazes await them once again, on their quest to save the world.    Trenton Lee Stewart is a graduate of the Iowa Writer's Workshop and also wrote adult novel Flood Summer. Stewart lives in Arkansas with his two sons and wife and when asked the question `which character in the Mysterious Benedict Society series are you most like/or wish to be like?' he answer that is changes with every coming day. \\""I wish I had Renyie's Shrewdness and his gift of perception, just as I wish I could read as quickly and remember as well as Sticky does, and be as acrobatic as Kate, and have a fraction of Constance's ability to say what she thinks.\\""     I'm delighted to say that I loved this book of the series, just as much as I loved the first. It's just a great book that really makes you think and not just read and goes into great detail that helps with the enjoyment.

I've never studied economics, so it's been fascinating reading this book. I'm definitely pro-capitalism, but I'm not convinced that unbridled capitalism is a completely good thing. The world doesn't have infinite resources to support that, and just because a limited resource/supply causes the price of something to go up doesn't mean that the problem is solved or that the supply is therefore adequate because there's enough for those who can afford the high prices.  I don't think that logical arguments are the author's strong point. Too many times I thought he was just stating something as a truth without supporting it. Perhaps those truths are obvious to him because of his background and knowledge of economics, but he needed to provide more to get the rest of us to see it, too.

He  is  a  humble  and  determined  man  who  sets  his  sights  on  his  intention  and  makes  it  happen.  Set  in  several  different  countries  and  over  a  span  of  35  years  of  upheaval  in  the  Middle  East  and  Eastern  Europe,  he  captures  so much  that  is  only  meaningful  from  the  first hand  experience.

The content in this book is very focused.<br /><br />First, the author attempts to correct the wrong reasons for capitalism's failure.  This is primarily a response to criticisms about price rigidity as well as the Marshall-Cournot theories on monopoly.  Regarding the Marshall-Cournot theories, Schumpeter explains that pure-competition, as opposed to monopolistic-competition, has both advantages and disadvantages to the consumer.  While monopolistic-competition may allow for some ability to bend production to the will of the profiteer, it also allows for economies of scale and the capacity to withstand supply/demand shocks (promoting stability to fight supply shortfalls especially).<br /><br />Next, the author addresses both the theory of the conservation of capital and the theory of vanishing investment opportunity.  The author's correct understanding of corporate finance and project profitability measurement makes it easy to see why the conservation of capital theory may at worst slow progress, and at best be irrelevant.  While the theory of vanishing investment opportunity is refuted in the short-term, his thesis seems to not fully reject it.  At some point, the author states, needs may be so satisfied (technologically I assume) that entrepreneurship ceases to exist (due to competitive investment driving interest and return on capital to zero as investment outlets disappear).  Thus, the primary tools which allow the bourgeois class to maintain class separation disappear.  The author does state that when this would occur is currently &#34;incalculable.&#34;  Further, and one of my reasons for 4 stars instead of 5, the author does not critically examine a corporate world with no entrepreneurship.  Do companies all approach pure-competition or monopoly? If each has advantages, surely an industry has no definitive &#34;end&#34; where competition may no longer be warranted.<br /><br />The last point I'd like to draw attention to is the author's linking of rationalism to capitalism.  This part was more philosophic, explaining how the first person in a primitive culture who decided to construct a bucket instead of doing a rain dance was not only rational, but was acting on capitalistic incentives.  However, the author continues his line of thought until coming to the breakdown of capitalist society from its own &#34;rational&#34; actions of its actors.  While I may have 75 more years of history from which to examine, it is difficult for me to agree with the cultural changes capitalism will encourage.  People still care about families, and even total strangers.  Profit guides, but compassion has not disappeared.  The greed that exists can exist in any economic system.  While I agree that a socialist system removes the tools which allow greed an outlet, this very greed often has just as many (if not more) positive effects on consumers than negative.  The author provides ingenious explanations of cultural changes due to capitalism's transition from feudalism, but not with regard to capitalism's future transition to socialism.nt I'd like to draw attention to is the author's linking of rationalism to capitalism.

The book seems targeted specifically for Unix admins, touching on actual problems and providing actual solutions.  On the face of it, it looks to be [[ASIN:0596009259 Programming Python]] with an OS-specific slant.    Unfortunately, the execution here just doesn't seem to be on a par with that of other O'Reilly books.  There is useful information to be had in this text, to be sure, but it's at times difficult to extract.    Perhaps my view of this book is tainted by my recent experience with [[ASIN:0596516177 The Ruby Programming Language]], one of the most enjoyable technical reference books I've ever encountered.  I'll spare you the details (I have a full review on that product page), but rarely have I felt such joy in reading about code.    I do not feel such joy when slogging through [[ASIN:0596515820 Python for Unix and Linux System Administration]].  I get the impression, at times, that the author should have simply let the code speak for itself, and spared us his narration entirely.    For example, here is a snippet from Chapter 3, on text manipulation:    \\""The final file method that we will discuss for getting text out of a file is readlines().  Readlines() is not a typo, nor is it a cut-and-paste error from the previous example.  Readlines() reads in all of the lines of a file.  Well, that is almost true.\\""    This text feels horribly labored to me.  He's telling us what readlines() is not, and it takes him a while to tell us what it actually is.  Also, note that Readlines() (with the capital \\""R\\"") is not valid; despite its use in the beginning of a sentence, the author should always use the proper capitalization of the method to avoid confusion.  Nitpick, perhaps, but this could catch somebody off guard.    Contrast this with the pydoc description of readlines():    \\""Call readline() repeatedly and return a list of the lines so read.  The optional size argument, if given, is an approximate bound on the total number of bytes in the lines returned.\\""    Clear, concise, and much more legible.  When I want to know about readlines(), I want to know what it does and what it is, not what it *doesn't* do and *almost* is.    This is just an example.  There are others, but I think you get the idea:  it's not a book you'll want to curl up with in front of the fire for a pleasant read.  Instead, this is a book that does have useful information in it, but you'll have to force yourself to dig it out.    The book does provide some useful examples for addressing specific problems, and if you have such a problem this might be exactly what you need.  Do not mistake this for a cookbook, though; it's a lengthy tutorial with real world examples, not a tome of useful hacks that you will be constantly calling upon.    In short: a workable introduction to a variety of useful techniques, though lacking a bit in quality compared to other O'Reilly books.  Unless you're really interested in some of the OS-specific topics covered in this book, the more general (and much more comprehensive) [[ASIN:0596009259 Programming Python]] will probably serve you better.","2008-12-18","2008","Books"

And I was not disappointed. So once again I have to thank her for writing such an amazing story.<br /><br />It revolves around a new society which is pretty messed up, to say the least. From the start you know everything isn’t fine and dandy like the higher powers portray and I loved how the details were slowly revealed throughout, working to keep you on the edge of your seat. That said, it was fast-paced, and a combination of the two made it an incredibly enjoyable read.<br /><br />I can’t pick a favourite part; there were simply so many amazing aspects! For instance the characters had plenty of depth, but more than that you immediately care about what happens - the book is quick to build connections between them and the reader. Em is someone I’d want as a friend (for many reasons including being a bad-ass) so long as I’m allowed to steal Rogue away from her… The two are great for each other and their conversations never cease to make me laugh but Rogue… *heartfelt sigh* I want him.<br /><br />Also I have to mention that Ren’s cameo/crossover made my day!<br /><br />In the end, it’s pretty clear that Noffke has a talent for writing books that capture my heart as well as my attention. I’m unbelievably excited to see where this series goes in the next book and in the meantime I’d recommend you pick up Defects.<br /><br />Posted on: http://enchantedbyya.blogspot.co.uk/","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

H. Griffith's classic \\""Black Like Me, \\"" as he takes a \\""walk on the wild side,\\"" posing as a Palestinian\\"" in a number of situational vignettes that take place both in the \\""occupied territory,\\"" as well as in Israel proper. Driven by the desire to get to know the \\""Palestinian mind,\\"" as well as to expose Israel's multilevel class ridden hypocritical society, rift with racial prejudices, among other problems, in the first half of the book the author comes just short of proving that our erstwhile middle Eastern democratic ally is little more than \\""Mississippi in drag,\\"" cira 1950.<br /><br />The earlier vingettes (as an itinerate workers in a variety of settings) call to mind the famous debate (Has Zionism Succeeded?)  between Ari Shavette and Jeffery Goldberg. The reader may recall that Shavette, in a spirited defense of Israel's errant ways with regard to its racist attitudes towards its Arab minorities, nevertheless did not try to sidestep the most important contradiction this issue raised for Israeli democracy: That given the very nature of Israel's establishment (on the ashes of the European Holocaust), Shavette stated with great conviction that for Israel \\""being \\""just\\"" is a moral imperative and [is perhaps] Israel's only [real] strategic asset.\\""<br /><br />What is most interesting about the first half of the book is that the author's change of identity, as he clandestinely went about infiltrating vignette after vignette, revealed Israel to be both a narrow racist nation, as well as one anxious to try to get the Palestinian crisis in its past. This ambivalence becomes much more pronounced in the second half of the book as the author continues to force his way into the very heart of Israeli life, including successfully becoming a volunteer in a Kubutz. But also, and this goes beyond the Griffith motif, he discovers a great deal about the anti-Semitic prejudices on the other side. He probes into how the Palestinians have come to \\""cope\\"" with their greatly diminished way of life, and how anti-Semitism, even when justified, also undermines the Palestinian cause and diminishes an already diminished Arab humanity. In the end, it is clear that it is the hatred on both sides that is eating away at the moral fiber of Israeli society.<br /><br />Although the book may not command the same classic status as Griffith's book, nor does it have the same gripping emotional impact, it does have its finer moments and is a much needed independent non-ideological view of Israel from the inside out. It is the perfect counterweight to the incessant and distorted American media view that Israel is a \\""perfect democracy\\"" and can do no wrong.<br /><br />Five Stars","2008-12-18","2008","Books"

One thing to keep in mind though, is that although the author doesn't ever say if the child is a boy or a girl, the illustrations look like a boy.  This book is perfect for our us, because I have a boy, but I'm not sure if it would have the same impact if I had a girl. Just something to keep in mind. P.K.

I couldn't agree with him more or be more saddened. I graduated from a well known progressive liberal arts college over forty years ago in history and social science. That experience has shaped my life in that it was there that I learned to think analytically. Both professionally and in my personal life, the skills that I learned during those years have shaped my approach to life and work and inculcated a lifelong passion for learning. Careerism and credentialism are no substitutes for intellectual curiosity, introspection, and deep immersion for a few formative years in the life of the mind.

And then the proverbial cat is out of the bag - the news spreads and the circus begins.<br /><br />Their small town is invaded by the press and those looking to be healed. The medical community pokes and prods Ava and the religious sects want to own her. Her widowed father Macon is torn between protecting his daughter and being caught up in the frenzy.<br /><br />While it is not a new premise for a book, Mott examines it with his own interpretation, exploring the themes of obligation, family, love and loss.  Mott has beautiful prose - his turns of phrases, descriptions and dialogues are eloquently expressed. It's worth reading slowly to savor the sense and the story he builds. People magazine called The Wonder of All Things 'spellbinding'.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the book, I found I didn't like many of the characters. I expected to find myself drawn to Ava, I was - but not a much as I felt I should be. I was very disappointed with Macon. My favourite character ended up being Brenda, Wash's grandmother. A series of vignettes from the past of Ava and her mother are a lovely interlude, but provide no answers as to why her mother died.<br /><br />Mott gives the reader an emotional ride of a read - you'll vacillate between sadness, shock, anger, hope, denial and more. And the ending? Fitting I think, but have the hankies ready.","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

Also it has historical significance, because it was the first time investigators were allowed to bug the chambers of high-level judges. Until then, there was no way to get at corruption in the highest judicial ranks. The man who went undercover is the same man who wrote the book: Terrance Hake. And he was an complete amateur! He knew nothing about how to go undercover to ferret out corruption. Yet his life was at stake. He learned as he went along. And as a result, something like 100 judges and lawyers and other court officers were arrested, indicted, and spent jail time.<br /><br />Aside from the fact that this book is so interesting, it's also hard to put down because it's a thriller. Danger is everywhere. Until the end, you didn't really know if the good guys (the FBI and other agencies) would win or not. Also there are surprises thrown at you, which I won't mention because it would spoil your enjoyment of the story.<br /><br />I read the book first in print, and then bought the Audible edition.  The narrator, Charles Constant, is a hell of a good narrator. He knows how to build suspense with his delivery (when it's appropriate), and how to create interesting characters with just his vocal intonations. Also, you can tell the difference between the various characters because of his skill with different vocal nuances. Listening to the story on Audible, after reading the print version, was like getting twice the enjoyment out of a single book.<br /><br />I've listened to this narrator Charles Constant before, and he's always good, with both fiction and non-fiction. But IMHO I especially love to hear him read historical material. His narration of the Bismark book was first class. And in this Greylord book too, he knows when to give drama to a scene, without being melodramatic. Not all narrators can do this.","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

The special ops/supernatural mix, just speaks to me, and Sasha is a terrific lead -- a tough yet sexy warrior with tactical smarts.<br /><br />Back from the first book is Sasha's love interest, Hunter who has shown her the Shadow Wolf side of her nature. Sasha is a bit  challenged  by her first `full moon heat' but she is coming to terms with her wolf self now that she now longer has to worry about becoming one of the demon infected monstrosities that she has been forced to kill in the past -  she stills bears some emotional scars from having to kill her infected former captain and pack leader. Elements of the conspiracy exposed in the last book carry forward into the story here and the Shadow Wolves addicted to demon virus are a challenging enemy and provide for battles and action packed moments. But some of the best moments of the book are when Sasha's using her brain as the weapon, especially when she scores a tactical 'hit' against the scheming vamps.<br /><br />The element of Sasha's having to deal with her first 'heat' as a werewolf adds some steamy moments to the story, but the real emotion comes from Hunter's struggle - he's dealing with his third flare-up of the demon taint he's carried since birth - and Sasha may have to do the unthinkable and 'put him down' should he succumb. I absolutely loved Hunter, and the whole Native American-ish culture of the Shadow Wolves -- I hope we don't lose him. But Bank's is keeping us on pins and needles by bringing back the Shogun the leader of the other non-tainted werewolf faction. There's is definitely still an attraction there and Sasha hasn't fully committed to Hunter, even if he does survive, but so far I am still rooting for Hunter.<br /><br />I can't even begin to do this book justice here. It has it all- a smart action pact story, great characters, some steam and some tugging of the heartstrings.

Sprig absolutely hates it when her dad has to go away because she knows she will miss him every minute of the day. This time is worse then before, however, since he will be gone for six weeks.<br /><br />Then there is Sprig's pesky older sister, Dakota, who thinks that because she just turned twelve, she can be the boss of Sprig. Always correcting Sprig, stealing her questions, and getting to talk to their dad first whenever he calls annoys Sprig very much.<br /><br />It gets worse when Dakota befriends the very mean Krsytee, who Sprig knows is a bad influence on her sister.<br /><br />What's Sprig to do to cope with her sibling situation? She comes up with a list of ten possible ways of Dakota disappearing. The list includes baking her sister into a cookie and crunching Dakota if she was a cucumber.<br /><br />Sprig's adventures continue when she finds out her father has to travel all the way to another country that she knows isn't safe, she becomes a hero, a boy enters her life, problems with her best friend stir up, and she discovers that maybe her sister isn't so bad after all!<br /><br />TEN WAYS TO MAKE MY SISTER DISAPPEAR was a very quick and easy read that contained so many wonderful events that made this novel heartwarming and well worth reading. Any child who has a family member away from home or a bossy older sibling can easily relate to what Sprig is going through. Mazer creates a story that the whole family can enjoy before bedtime.<br /><br />The book definitely exceeded my expectations, and once it is read, you will definitely want more of Sprig!<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Randstostipher \\""tallnlankyrn\\"" Nguyen","2008-12-18","2008","Books"

Frankfurt's main task is to dilineate between outright lies and bs. He comes to the conclusion that a lie is something that cares about the truth value of a proposition while bs does not care. Bs is expressed simply to meet some goal and not to tell either a truth or a falsehood. This definition is sensible in modern use of the term. Think about that essay question on an exam and how you bs'ed your way through it - this implies that you don't really care about the truth-value of your answer to the question but you were simply trying not to fail.     Do we need bs to be defined? Not really since I think we all could come up with similar ideas as that of Frankfurt. One thing he very briefly touches upon is whether or not the amount of bs in greater in the world now than before. He intimates that nowadays everybody has to have an opinion on everything so naturally people are bs'ing more because they feel they need an opinion on something they are totally ignorant. I think it's a good point.    Also, this book costs too much. Get it at the library if you must.  By the way, the follow-up book On Truth is much better.","2008-12-18","2008","Books"

(Shouldn't happen, right?)  The author wastes no opportunity to criticize anything that is not &#34;natural psychology,&#34; whether the target is ADHD medication, religion, or a sleeping pill.  On passage in particular strikes me as a complete swing-and-a-miss.  In the chapter &#34;The Lure of Mysticism&#34; he writes:  &#34;Built into this rationale for mysticism [mysticism in the author's view is anything religious] is the idea that man would fall apart if he acknowledged that life was just this:  'just this' translating as 'empty, cold, impersonal, and purposeless.'  But that isn't the right acknowledgement.  The choices aren't between a false but soothing mysticism and an acceptance of an indifferent universe.  Rather, the choice is between an easy mysticism and genuine mystery.  This is a very different choice!  It is one that a smart person can embrace and applaud--and even grow excited about.  He never again has to bang his head against the brick wall of mystery.  He can just let it be mysterious.&#34;  What a terrible piece of advice for gifted people.  Does the author think that a gifted individual will be content with that solution?  Gifted people cannot let anything be mysterious!  That's what makes gifted people different from the average person:  they search for answers and explanations; they search for meaning in everything from engineering to philosophy to theology to history to biology.  It is over those existential questions that gifted people stew--and those same gifted people will not be content with &#34;let it be mysterious&#34; as an answer.  The author also repeatedly mentions that we as a species were not created by God and that we are merely nature's experiments.  Regardless of your opinions on the question of the existence of a Supreme Being,  not allowing gifted people the option to even think about God as an explanation of the universe and their own existenceand describing such an option as a &#34;lure&#34; (implying that it is somehow inherently bad) is a huge mistake.  Again, that's what gifted people do!  They think about everything.  The author mentions how gifted people can see through arguments.  &#34;They shake their heads when clerics, politicians, and economists speak.&#34;  (p. 96).   I shook my head reading this book.  It's not a helpful book as far as advice for gifted people on how to live with their faster-than-average brains.  It is, however, a good description of the author's personal beliefs about the world in general and about how gifted people think.  It's not completely wrong; sometimes his descriptions of how bright people think are fairly accurate.","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

This trio of psychologists doesn't go that far, but the authors do lay an extensive framework for applying psychoanalytic psychology, systems analysis and family therapy to the family business arena. getAbstract thinks that this serious text may be more of a resource for therapists, counselors and consultants than reading material for people who take only a casual interest in family businesses or who are looking for a quick fix. Authors Manfred Kets de Vries and Randel Carlock, writing with Elizabeth Florent-Treacy, delve deeply into the human dynamics that affect family-run companies, including the psychology of the individuals involved, the characteristics of entrepreneurs and the business family-paradigm. They look closely at human and organizational life cycles, and study how emotional volatility intensifies in times of transition. The authors make generous use of case studies, diagrams and models, and demonstrate how they've applied their methodology to advise troubled family businesses.","2008-12-18","2008","Books"

Father Paul Keenan is a dear friend of mine who passed away on June 10, 2008. He is truly one of the most open-hearted, kindest souls I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. When I was just a struggling author with a new book called GRACES, he invited me to appear on his two radio programs, \\""As You Think\\"" and the national ABC radio program, \\""Religion on the Line.\\"" He said my book GRACES had a \\""grassroots freshness\\"" and that he was tired of the \\""same old prayers.\\"" Father Paul is refreshingly honest. Back in 1994, he mentioned that he did a little writing on the side. I said I would love to look at his writing. I was so deeply moved by his heart and his thoughts as well as the excellent quality of his writing that I introduced Father Paul to my literary agent, Denise Marcil. Father Paul's first book was GOOD NEWS FOR BAD DAYS, followed up by many other books. I highly recommend that you buy all of them. His dearest friend, Susan Zappo, is seeing that all of his royalties are going to good causes. She has also given her loving home to Father Paul's two cats. Father Paul was a huge lover of animals--and people, of course! Please visit his website, [...] to capture a little essence of Father Paul's spirit. We lost a truly great man, a truly great priest, and I lost a truly great friend. Please buy this book and help his inspiring words continue to live on. Thank you.","2008-12-18","2008","Books"

Enhanced with stellar examples ranging in severity and repercussion, from thousands dead to marriages failed, this is a psychology book that Shows more than Telling, letting you do the math.. but also showing how it adds up. Or with the dissonance theory, which it does adequately explain, it shows how sometimes, our cognitive dissonance makes it so that our decisions Don't add up, and why its so hard for us to be fair when faced with dissonance. This book helps us realize how humans, although hard wired to Skew the facts in our perceived favor.. Are able to get around the tragedies of dissonant thinking.<br />It's a psychology book, with a touch of self help because.. as it so fairly points out, We are all guilty of mistakes, Yet, its those of us who can admit to them that are the one who tend to recover from them, learn from them, and even be more valued and trusted by society-- more often.<br />Less likely to make the same mistake again.<br />One of the most interesting ideas it posed through numerous example, was that people Acclimate themselves step by step to immoral behavior, escalating in severity. Thankfully,  no ones bad, no ones good, We are all capable of Vast misgivings.

This, his English-language debut, is a solid novel that unfortunately loses its bite in the last third.<br /><br />The first 2/3 of this novel are outstanding - fast moving, intimate characterizations and a look inside Swedish politics/magazine wars/corruption/wealth.  Larsson combines this with a decades-old missing persons mystery that keeps you guessing, for a while.<br /><br />Regretably, the denoument of the major mystery of this book is solved too soon and the ultimate revenge plot that fills up the rest of the novel is just not very interesting.  This book would have benefited from tighter editing and cutting about 100 pages from the text.  I do hope his next English-language release (he signed a deal for 3 books before he died) has more bite because Larsson is definitely a solid writer.","2008-12-18","2008","Books"

As you find out, if you hear the bullet, passing at twice the speed of sound, you are safe, at least for that instant. But, another one always waited.<br /><br />The strain of battered nerves on sleep-deprived, poorly-fed, lonely, cold, and mud-encrusted men under weeks of attack without rest in some cases, permeates this grim but not wholly forlorn account. Published in 1978, Winter extracts the telling entry from dozens of published and unpublished memoirs. He emphasizes: \\""Studied from the bottom and looking upwards, the Great War becomes less useful to staff college students and more meaningful to the layman-- and to old soldiers of any war.\\"" (16) Rather than battles, the foggy terror and chaotic results of war as seen from the men who fought on the ground appear more unstructured, haphazard, and emotional. \\""What the scholar sees today as a single event, the participant was aware of only as a rapid succession of brilliant cameos, suffused with tension and fear.\\"" (170) Out of this \\""common memory\\"" as recorded by veterans, in diaries, letters and books, Winter recreates the common man's endurance, or capitulation.<br /><br />His style carries his narrative sharply along, fitting the subject. Speaking of marching: \\""The worries, anxieties and traumas of the individual, beaded on the rosary of memory, were lost in the mass. They were not lost for the future; just overlain by tendrils from men totally responsive towards each other.\\"" (76) Telling the various sounds made by rifles, we find the \\""most dangerous was the brief roar of a near miss. It was just like a violin string breaking, followed by the report of the rifle firing it, like a popping champagne cork.\\"" (109) Or, compare this utterly British sentence that sums up the end of an era: \\""The Earl of Faversham's deerhound was a well-known sight on the salient, urinating on table tops and following his master to the isolated grave on the Somme where he still lies today.\\"" (156)<br /><br />Chapters take you through the call-up for \\""Kitchener\\"" recruits, the training of \\""Other Ranks,\\"" how soldiers had to adopt to the Army; officer training; shipment to France; trench life, weaponry used there, and the strain; rest and home leave; battle and its aftermath; attitudes towards the Germans and to the war itself; and what happened after the war. The mass of information can overwhelm you, and this may be an advantage for those wishing to immerse themselves as if in the trenches, but others may prefer to take chapters in smaller sections, given their intensity of topic and treatment. There are no cross-references, nearly no endnotes, and surnames follow each other as if imitating how soldiers speak of each other by surname. The works are all listed at the end, but specific pages or citations are not documented. While this makes the book more readable, historians or scholars may demand more. Still, as a general reader with only cursory knowledge of the events, I was able to follow the gist easily. Winter cares about the men and their memories, and this empathy energizes his telling of their tales.<br /><br />32 monochrome photos suffer from their printing in a mass-market paperback, but their captions show Winter's scrutiny continues when he analyzes imagery visually as well as verbally from his sources. A horrific one of a shell victim informs us that British \\""photo archives were carefully vetted so that very few pictures of dead Englishmen remain.\\"" Another shows how among the dead, crosses on top of their corpses with identity discs ready, the stretcher-bearer also lies among those he tried to rescue. 60% of a unit might suffer casualties in one battle; half of these were \\""walking wounded.\\"" Doctors operated only with morphine, bandages, and knives.If no pills, nurses injected a placebo of sterile water into raving, ravaged patients. \\""Probably the luckiest men were the prisoners,\\"" a third caption laconically observes.<br /><br />I found the chapter on \\""Rest\\"" less informative than I would have wished. \\""Home Leave\\"" also appears nearly a blur, if understandably given the informants' own experience, or lack of much leave for many. Perhaps this comparative reticence when it comes to billets, ladies, and boozing behind the lines can be blamed on the lack of titillating or in-depth coverage in the primary sources relied upon by Winter. Women's roles, again reflecting the male-dominated context of every source, gain less attention than they might in a more recent social history of the period. After all, this is about the \\""soldiers\\"" rather than nurses or prostitutes or auxiliaries.<br /><br />One forgets that these millions of soldiers often led circumscribed lives for years; despite useless drill and aimless marching about when in boot camp, they might go months before seeing an enemy soldier, dug into their holes as they were on both sides. When death came, it was not usually under direct confrontation as it had been in earlier combats. Winter takes us in along toy-like men waiting to charge in haunting fashion. You feel their shock as they're pulled into a panoramic nightmare.<br /><br />\\""This appalling noise seemed to come anonymously, for the enemy was hardly to be seen. Attacking 10,000 Germans, a soldier might perhaps see ten. Shells represented the enemy by proxy, bursting with a vast upward rush of black smoke, lit from underneath by a red flame. As treble to the bass of the shells were the machine-guns, engines letting off steam, and sniper-fire sounding like twigs crackling underfoot.\\"" (178-9) Rarely did they flinch, or desert, or malinger. Mass pressure to conform and support their fellow troops appeared their motivation, discipline that overcame fright. After so long ducking, standing men felt naked, exposed as if plunging into a cold bath as they hunkered down under a barrage. Many at first might feel abstracted; still intact they might savor the thrill of assault. This joy jolted men; five minutes of battle seemed to exhaust men as if they had labored for a day straight. Their faces showed the strain and the shock afterwards.<br /><br />More often than the dreaded \\""going over the top\\"" to attack, the end to their tour of duty fell invisibly, if among great tumult. Confusion certainly becomes a motif here, in fatigue as well as battle. Few knew the reasons why they bivouacked where the campaign placed them. Patriotism loomed. Many enlisted men, Winter estimates, back then conformed readily, schooled by poverty or a static upbringing to passively serve their \\""betters.\\"" Traditionally, they obeyed, kept up routines, and waited for the order to fix bayonets. This probably led up to a rare encounter with their intimate enemy. Winter quotes \\""the greatest cartoonist of the war, Raemakers.\\"" A German cradles a dying British soldier, who looks up and asks him: \\""Is it you, Mother?\\"" (206) Many memoirists verify this last scene witnessed as they comforted their mortally wounded mates, although the enemy seemed less likely to offer solace.<br /><br />Even the mythologized Christmas truce still did not allow men to let their guard down long, out of fear or revenge. Soon, we read of Germans killed on their knees as they held up pictures of their wives or children; danger appears, Winter explains, to lessen hatred in battle, but once men are out of immediate peril, their reaction of bloodlust often continues. Still, a twisted humanity remains; a soldier recalls praying for his targets as he mowed each German down. Attacking as if dreaming--  alternating with vivid vignettes of slaughtered individuals emergingfrom the mist or reverie, whether comrades or foes-- appears to punctuate veterans' scattered, inchoate recollections of the dreaded yet hypnotizing zero hour of engagement.<br /><br />The bulk of the work, naturally, lodges less in combat face-to-face than hunkered down in the trenches alongside the men. Among the rats, vermin, corpses, and stench, men burrowed in and hoped to live. Their stories enliven these pages as their conversations, in passing as if overheard by Winter, occasionally float behind the words he studies. These veterans find that battle leaves them indelibly altered; they long to speak of war whenever they meet another soldier, no matter his side. This collection as it sifts their tales depicts tedium as well as terror, holed up within strange fortifications in this war of attrition on bodies and minds, fought by fragile men from upended castles, implanted solidly into the dirt.<br /><br />Certainly any of us finishing these sad pages, now that nearly all the veterans of the war to end all wars have died, find our problems reduced by comparison. I was amazed at how those men not inclined to serve, once recruited or conscripted with primitive equipment, impractical training, and brutal regimens, survived the worst. Many, of course, did not. This contrast, between those relating their memories and those about whom they wrote, often left behind in the mud or obliterated beneath it, leave a poignancy and a dignity for the \\""preciousness of life\\"" difficult to conjure up at a remove. Nine percent of British men under forty-five died in the war, yet their losses were dwarfed by civilians and soldiers in France and Germany. Winter brings us as close as most of us will ever want to approach the consciousness of tattered, anxious, and exhausted men, who found the stubbornly remembered range of cruelty and decency over four years at their extremity.llow troops appeared their motivation, discipline that overcame fright.

And people have not stopped talking about it. Not that they buy Walsh and Keesmaat hook, line, and sinker. But the underlying question the authors raise has stirred us to some significant thinking. That question is, What does it mean to live faithfully in the Empire, assuming that the Church and the Empire are not one and the same? For Christians who find life just fine in the 21st century capitalistic, militaristic, nationalistic, exceptionalistic US of A this book will be a source of outrage and irritation (e.g see some of the reviews found on this page). For those with a growing conviction that the US church has become too cozy with the state and with the \\""benefits\\"" of consumption, this book provides some biblical and theological resources for the journey ahead. Highly recommended.","2008-12-18","2008","Books"

If you don't like reading books that take forever to get into the good stuff this is it. Since it is broken into 14 short stories you're easily brought to suspense within a few sentences. You begin your journey in the first story Autopsy Room 4. Which immediately your given the image of a man laying on an autopsy bed being ready to get cut up but here's the kicker he's still alive. How did the man end up there and will he survive? Well I guess you'll just have to read the book. The characters in most all of his story reflect Steven king a great deal they are often writers and come from Maine, like Steven King himself. As you continue reading this book it is one gripping short story after another and you never know if the next one will be more or less enthusiastic than the last one. One of my favorite stories had to have been the man in the black suit. This is for several reasons, one it was based on a true even that happened to his friends' grandfather and two the description in this story was amazing, \\""his eyes were the orangey-red of flames in a wood stove.\\"" This book will have you clawing for the next story as you travel through out the book, they are in no specific order the order was decided when the author labeled cards 1-14 and drew them so you'll never know what's coming next.

Reagle, Jr., who is Assistant Professor of Communications Studies at Northwestern University. He lays out how comments -a genre of communication in their own right, if not always respectable or respected- \\""inform, improve, manipulate, alienate, shape, and perplex,\\"" to which function he dedicates a chapter each. In his introductory chapter, Reagle points out that too much success in a comment platform can spell its demise, as too many comments cause a community to deteriorate from \\""intimate serendipity toward filtered sludge.\\"" Each subsequent chapter introduces one type or aspect of comments, briefly places it in its historical context -comments didn't begin with the internet, talks about the good and the bad, and what has been done to try to combat the latter.<br /><br />The chapters address product reviews (Informed), deliberate manipulation of reviews and ratings (Manipulated), feedback such as peer criticism (Improved), trolls and depersonalization on the web (Alienated), how the web shapes self-image and self-esteem (Shaped), comical comments and unfortunate misinterpretations (Bemused). Reagle provides a reasonably good overview of what goes on in comments and how users may benefit or potentially be harmed by them. But there is not much analysis, insight, or nuance. Reagle isn't a social scientist. He quotes some social scientists. If you wanted to get at what is going on, why, and what its implications may be from many angles, each type of comment would require its own book. An overview doesn't tell the average netizen anything he or she doesn't already know; it gives organization to what we already know.<br /><br />There are a few areas in which I think the author could have done better, even as a survey. I was surprised that the merits of real names versus pseudonyms are not debated anywhere in this book. And it's not always clear, unless the reader is familiar with the web site being discussed, when Reagle refers to a comment as \\""anonymous\\"", whether he may in some cases mean \\""pseudonymous.\\"" The chapter on trolls focuses primarily on harassment and threatening comments made to women, but the cases he uses as examples are not typical. They include cases in which the alleged victim benefitted materially by claiming distress and cases that are likely to evoke disagreement, including among women, over whether or not the comments were inappropriate. These are famous cases. Studies about women and flaming or more run-of-the-mill incidents would make a stronger point.<br /><br />Some comments Reagle makes about Amazon reviews and votes betray a lack of familiarity with Amazon's policing methods. For example, he wishes Amazon \\""did more to remove fraudulent reviews and helpfulness votes.\\"" Actually, Amazon's algorithms are very aggressive in these areas, to the point that many legitimate votes and reviews are removed. He would like Amazon reviewers to have visible \\""data portraits\\"" that would show our review statistics. Amazon had a feature similar to what Reagle describes. When a customer hovered over the reviewer's or commenter's name, a pop-up with that person's number of reviews, percentage of positive votes, and most used tags popped up. It was helpful in spotting shill reviewers, but Amazon discontinued the feature, presumably in order to simplify the code.

Faust or Eddie. This hugely talented man has quite a commanding and jolly presence and wants Pamela to create for him a showstopping outdoor fountain to match the one within the Forum Shops of Caesar's Palace. Complete with animated statue of Bacchus. While she's busy thinking up ways to make this monstrosity into something elegant and classy, she's unaware that just beyond the plain white service door lies a portal to Mount Olympus and that a bunch of randy, hot to trot, gods and goddesses are about to crash the party.<br /><br />Apollo, the God of Light has been in a funk. He thought he had known love before, but after witnessing the love between Lina and Hades, he realizes his shallow existence and puny attempts at knowing love pales in comparison. His twin sister, Artemis is tired of his funk and drags him off to the Kingdom of Las Vegas to lift his spirits. There they become embroiled in an intrigue by Bacchus, who is trying to get the newely arrived gods and goddesses thrown out of Vegas. Bacchus considers Las Vegas to be his own realm and when he sees a chance to bind Artemis to a mortal woman, he snatches at that chance and hopes that the ensuing tangle will be enough to go before Zeus and have him close the portal. Unfortunately for him, Bacchus has created the perfect opportunity for Apollo to finally meet a modern mortal woman and when he sees Pamela he's only too happy to answer her wish for romance. Not to be outdone, Bacchus arranges it for Apollo and Artemis to be trapped in Las Vegas, without their powers, and yet again, all it does is allow the God of Light to fall more in love with Pamela. Enraged, this spiteful and vindictive God of Wine does the one thing forbidden to him by Zeus. He meddles in human affairs with tragic consequences and it tears Pamela and Apollo apart. With the help of Lina and Hades, Pamela is given a second chance at life, and Apollo is given a second chance for love.<br /><br />Another charming retelling of Greek myth by P.C. Cast. I was a little hesitant to read this book because after having read so much of Sherrilyn Kenyon's version of Artemis and Apollo I was sure I was going to despise them, but P.C. Cast definitely puts her own spin on things and I really enjoyed Artemis in this story. She was fun and haughty and was just snarky enough to steal the show. Apollo was good, too, but he definitely paled in comparison to his sister. He had all the love and devotion that Hades had for Lina, but he was missing that hard-edged intensity that the Lord of the Underworld had so he paled in comparison to Hades, too. Poor guy wandered about this book mostly in a state of morose, no-one-loves-me funk and after he found Pamela he only marginally improves. He was definitely cute in a bewildered sort of way, but without his powers he became very uncertain and nervous. I liked Pamela, she has a sad past, but she doesn't let it get in the way of a happy future. My only problem with her was that she needed a good hard slap because she kept saying the word, \\""gihugic.\\"" That's not a word and anyone who says that needs to be slapped. Hard.<br /><br />For me, the ending saved the book from becoming yet another sappy, perfect little romance. I actually like endings like this. They are so hopeful and inspiring. I know a lot of people hate endings like this but I just find them very romantic. It made me cry a little and it made me really like Artemis all the more. I don't know if I can continue to hate her when I read more Dark-Hunter books from Sherrilyn Kenyon but I'm sure I'll find out. That this book took place in Las Vegas was an absolute treat for me and I loved the descriptions of the Forum Shops in Caesar's Palace. I actually used to love that Atlantis show and reading about it brought back a lot of fond memories. Anyways, this was another lovely book by P.C. Cast where she puts her own unique spin on Greek myth. Enjoy!Enjoy!","2008-12-18","2008","Books"

The illustrations Arthur Rackham made for this classic in 1915, with mostly lithe figures and spare coloring do great justice to the tale of an elderly miser, who, on the anniversary of his business partner's death on Christmas Eve, is forced to review his life, and is offered a final chance for redemption.    The tale of Ebenezer Scrooge could be viewed as an early novel of spiritual psychoanalysis.    After readers learn of Scrooge's character flaws--his stinginess, his cold-hearted attitude towards people, including a nephew and his wife, who are his only family--he is confronted by the ghost of his business partner, Jacob Marley, who, despite Scrooge's reluctance, shows him his long chain, explains its significance, and warns him to amend his ways.     Scrooge is visited by three spirits--the first being the child-like, white-haired Ghost of Christmas Past, who makes Scrooge retrace his steps in life, causing him to review a harsh and lonely childhood, which is tempered by consolation from his loving but ill-fated sister, Fan, his happier years as an apprentice to a man named Fezziwig, and finally, he recognizes how his singular pursuit of wealth at all costs resulted in the loss of his fiancee, Belle.     The Ghost of Christmas Present is the most joyous and festive of the apparitions.Sitting in a well-lit room at a table with a glorious bounty when he first encounters Scrooge, he escorts his elderly charge through London,  where he sees the spirit of the season among the people, and  visits the houses of his employee, Bob Cratchit, and that of his nephew, Fred. He learns of the plight of Cratchit's son, Tiny Tim, discovers how he is viewed in both households, is shown the impact of poverty among those whom he has the potential to help, and lastly warned about the consequences of Want and Ignorance.   The third spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come, is the darkest, most foreboding of the phantoms. It is hooded, faceless, and silent as it shows the old man the possible future, pointing to significant details with a clammy hand as Scrooge realizes that he has reaped what he has sown.      Back in his bed at the end of a chilling night's journey, Scrooge sees the potential to be a better man than before. He has come to terms with his past, learns to rejoice in the present, and to create a better future for those around him.    Ebenezer...In Hebrew, the name means \\""Stone of Help\\"", which may well be why Dickens chose it for one of his most famous characters.In the end, a formerly miserly old man does a fine job of becoming just that!","2008-12-18","2008","Books"

This, his English-language debut, is a solid novel that unfortunately loses its bite in the last third.<br /><br />The first 2/3 of this novel are outstanding - fast moving, intimate characterizations and a look inside Swedish politics/magazine wars/corruption/wealth.  Larsson combines this with a decades-old missing persons mystery that keeps you guessing, for a while.<br /><br />Regretably, the denoument of the major mystery of this book is solved too soon and the ultimate revenge plot that fills up the rest of the novel is just not very interesting.  This book would have benefited from tighter editing and cutting about 100 pages from the text.  I do hope his next English-language release (he signed a deal for 3 books before he died) has more bite because Larsson is definitely a solid writer.","2008-12-18","2008","Books"

Freezing, short on rations and ammunition, and nearly buried in successive waves of Chinese soldiers, the Marines held Fox Hill for seven days, permitting their fellow Marines to evacuate an unsustainable position at Yudam-ni.<br /><br />This book is the real deal.  The level of detail in the narrative is simply awe-inspiring.  Often we know what happened down to the minute.  Individuals are followed throughout the battle and we learn of their personal fates.  The Marines display courage and even a sense of humor in the face of death, but nothing is sugar-coated for us.  The men on Fox Hill took heavy casualties.  Many of those who did not die immediately were scarred for life.  Wounds went untreated, but the men fought on, and their pain is described in detail.  Frostbite was nearly as debilitating as bullet wounds, and weapons often refused to function in the bitter cold.<br /><br />The book is not all blood and guts.  There are some intriguing tidbits of information.  We learn about General Macarthur's plan to create a nuclear \\""dead zone\\"" between Korea and China by exploding thirty nuclear bombs along the Yalu River.  The description of the Chinese soldiers was fascinating.  Some of them fought without socks in the sub-zero weather.  Occasionally, Chinese officers dressed in Gilbert and Sullivan finery wandered into rifle range where they were instantly cut down.  And the Chinese buglers blew \\""Taps\\"" at dawn.  A series of fine maps show the shifting positions and attack vectors throughout the ordeal.<br /><br />\\""The Last Stand of Fox Company\\"" is one of the best war books I have ever read.  Readers looking for a story of heroism against the forces of nature and overwhelming odds will not be disappointed.","2008-12-18","2008","Books"

Studio potting, in contrast to the giant pottery factories, was just getting started and would become the dominate form of potters in England and North America. While they made a large variety of pottery the Martin Brothers are no doubt most famous for the grotesques in the form of face pots and tobacco jars. The tobacco jars were usually the now famous and very valuable 'Wally' birds named after their creator, the oldest brother, Wallace Martin.<br /><br />I have the original addition published in 1978 with 270 photos, mostly of their pots and the Martin Brothers Studio, of which 26 are in color. Many of the colored pictures are full page plates with often a dozen or more pots. Color is important as the Martin Brothers used a wide variety of colored glazes and the Wally Birds are very colorful.<br /><br />The book covers the life and art of the Martin Brothers. It is of value to anyone interested in the history of pottery, including collectors. But, the real value to me is to see the creativity and skill especially of Wallace the oldest brother. Putting faces on pots has a long 4000 years or more tradition with potters. Wallace's face pots and his birds have had a large influence with their quirky sense of humor.<br /><br />As a potter I highly recommend this book to potters looking for more information about these interesting potters and their amazing pots.","2015-08-15","2015","Books"

And he says that that is the EXPLANATION that N.T. Wright is overlooking when he tells people that skeptics can't offer a better explanation to the start and rise of Christianity (besides the truth of the resurrection). There is a major flaw in Widen's \\""better\\"" explanation. Christianity was hurting cults in the worst way, financially! Why did the Romans persecute Christians when anyone who knows anything about Roman history knows that the Romans were famous for allowing conquered peoples to continue practicing their beliefs? The Roman policy allowed new religions, especially in newly conquered lands, to practice their beliefs as long as they didn't cause problems for the Romans. The Christians, however, caused problems, financial problems. They had a different message for the world, and when Roman cultists were attracted to it, attendance at pagan temples decreased. Former cult member stop buying statues of the pagan gods, stopped buying and offering sacrifices to those gods. In some areas economic crises occurred.<br /><br />  Pure Christianity is a terrible threat to any cult and any religion that is for profit. There is a saying that can be proven all throughout the history of Christianity, \\""The church persecuted is the church pure; the church popular is the church polluted.\\"" Profit was not a part of CHristianity until Constantine got his hands on it and made it POPULAR (4th century). When a church is persecuted there is no reason to be involved in it unless it is for sincere reasons (no financial advantage, fear for your safety, etc.). When Rome made Christianity the official religion all the rats came in and polluted it because now there was money and power to be had. So before that time Christianity was a total disease to any cult, they most certainly would not RECRUIT people. What reason on Earth would money grubbing cultists have for doing that?grubbing cultists have for doing that?","2008-12-18","2008","Books"

Shiraz is a very lovable character. I wasn't sure about this book at first. First off I had idea what a Chav was, and the cover scared me a little.... But once I started reading I was sucked into to Shiraz's voice. The novel consists of journal entries. Think Sloppy first, British style.<br /><br />I may not have understood everything she was saying (thankfully there was an English dictionary for all the American cousins) but the girl is bloody brilliant!<br /><br />Some of my favorites:<br /><br />Baps: (n.) boobs. Also boobies, breasts, blouse potatoes.<br /><br />Fangita-eater: (n.) this is a pretty, erm, rude word for a girl who things other girls are hot and doesn't fancy boys.<br /><br />Knob: (n.) a boys penis. But it's also an insult too. \\""Stop being a knob!\\""<br /><br />Marmite: (n.) brown yeast extract spread that British people have on toast, which to an American person who isn't used to it will taste like Satan's jockstrap.<br /><br />Up the duff: (adj.) pregnant, knocked up, in the pudding club.<br /><br />Despite what you would initially think, Shiraz is very smart. And unfortunately it isn't something that her environment encourages. Her mother seems to think that a rich husband is the way that Shiraz needs to go. Which is very sad. But while reading the novel you'll soon learn that Shiraz is not the type of girl to settle down with a rich husband, she has a mind of her own. She has typical teenage problems. Figuring what to do with your life, working through friendships, problems with boys, it's all in there and humorously done.<br /><br />While this novel lacks elegance and grace... if your looking for brutally honest, this just might be your ticket. I'm looking forward to hearing more of Shiraz's voice.","2008-12-18","2008","Books"

The theory is one mainly to include depression situations, too. That's why he calls it \\""General\\"" and \\""of employment, interest and money\\"".<br />Keynes focuses on paradoxa and instincts instead of on an artificial Homo Oeconomicus.<br />He sees the state as helpful to solve in the short-term - \\""In the long run, we are all dead\\"" -, but neither is he a blind state-follower. Keynes sure is different from Keynesianism, Neokeynesianism, Marxism, Neoliberalism, ... he seems to be quite proud of his nonconformism and turns to sarcastic aphorisms here and there. These also make the book more readable.<br /><br />On this edition: the 380 pages plus index look like a photographic reprint of the original.<br />  Maths surely helps if you aim for 100%, but you will get the conclusions in all cases. To non-native speakers: Keynes' English is finest British E. There are more systematic writers than Keynes, for sure, though. And there are points that might be outdated, but judge for yourself.<br /><br />2008/09 seems to illustrate what John Maynard Keynes described already in 1935/36, 73 years ago! The federal bank has no interest tool any longer then, as there cannot be an interest rate even lower than zero.<br /><br />Hopefully, enough people might re-read this book and/or other good analysis to step beyond the naive, almost religious belief in \\""Market\\"" etc. that have been blinding too many for too long.<br /><br />((A personal recommendation to German readers: [[ASIN:3821856785 Abschied vom Homo Oeconomicus: Warum wir eine neue &ouml;konomische Vernunft brauchen]]: unorthodox synthesis approach to economics by Gunter Dueck.

The book presents some thought provoking ideas about reading, brain development, language, cognitive science and education.<br /><br />I was introduced to this material via the audiobook, and then sought out the text afterwards.  Some of the sections which discuss phenomena such as dyslexia are made very poignant and human by her personal accounts.  From that sense she does a good job of making the material present and relevant. Obviously the text works well as a reference because it includes the references and visual aids that an audio-book cannot.  Similarly, the material may be somewhat difficult to digest in the audio format.  But as a compliment to the text, it is a very worthy and useful audio-book.  So the content is wonderful in both, and the two mediums work well together to deliver a lot of technical material very effectively.<br /><br />The book is a somewhat mixed bag of public policy and science.  While plenty of scientific material is sprinkled throughout, it is mixed with large doses of the author's opinions on how parents, educators and policy-makers should ensure that children continue to read.  To a degree I could see somebody appreciating many of the arguments more if they were pushed a little less subjectively.  Certainly the author's expertise makes her views very informed and worth hearing.  But I personally prefer less of a pointed telling.  The many examples also add some unneeded heft to the content that at times can be repetitious.  Indeed, some might argue that this could have been an even better achievement if some of that had been trimmmed out.<br /><br />Maryanne Wolf's successful career as a cognitive neuroscientist cannot be understated, and where this book shines is in the obviously strong technical foundation to the author's arguments.  One of the central themes revolves around the fact that people have no genetic direction to read, and thus all of the steps of human development that allow reading and language itself to advance must be deliberate.  The author in fact seems to draw value judgments betweeen different types of reading, and I'm not entirely certain I would completely agree with all of her conclusions.  Still, it is certainly thought-provoking and interesting material all the way through.<br /><br />One of the most daunting and impressive things about the audio-book is the incredible length of the unabridged version.  Eight and a half hours of material spread out over 7 compact disks is a lot of content to rip to your MP3 player and then listen to.  Considering the ground covered in the book, it's great to have this material in the audio format to listen to at my leisure when I'm multi-tasking.  Of course, I think in order to fully appreciate this material it helps to have some background on the subject.<br /><br />The writing style of this book at times seems to alternate between flowery and clinical.  In that sense, the audio-book feels easier to get through, even if it still works best as a supplement to the text.  Once again, if you believe in substance over style none of those things will bother you.  But it does make for some less enjoyable sections.  Still, those criticisms are overshadowed as a whole by the quality of content and the thought-provoking treatment of some very complex subjects.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />This book provides a treasure trove of thought provoking concepts about the brain and reading.  It's been a long time since I read about the brain, which once was a topic I read about frequently.  This book definitely provides some foundation and motivation for me to return to that pursuit.  While both the written text and the audio-book are somewhat large to digest on their own, together they supplement each other rather well.  I would recommend either to those who are interested in this topic.<br /><br />Enjoy.","2008-12-18","2008","Books"

They just purchased Tracy's dream home in Jacksonville, Florida. The good life is destroyed when Dwight is offered a promotion, but has to move to Maryland. Tracy selfishly decides that she wants no part of it and will not be moving. She sends Dwight on his way. Alone in a new city, Dwight takes comfort with his coworker, Alicia Dixon. The attraction is mutual but they both respect that he is a married man. As time goes on and Dwight realizes his marriage with Tracy is crumbling, he leans more and more towards a relationship with Alicia.     Alicia finds out that she is pregnant and the whole game changes. For years, she has declared never to get married or have children. In the blink of an eye, life changes. Dwight ends his marriage to Tracey to start a new life with Alicia. Life could not get any better. That is because it got a whole lot worse.     Candice Dow and Daaimah S. Poole come together for a great collaboration with We Take This Man. The story is told from the point-of -view of both women. The back and forth between the women is hilarious. The drama is never ending. The solution they come up with is unbelievable. Another book that I read in one night. You will not want to put this down. You will be on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. I have never read anything by Dow but I read Poole's, Yo Yo Love.

I was sorely dissappointed.  The first half of the book did have its interesting moments and offered some insights into the man.  The second half takes a truly ugly turn.  It moves from a radical position on impeachment to a wandering analysis of AIDS in Africa that has little to do with Clinton.  The author frequently uses terms like \\""vast right wing conspiracy\\"" and \\""thugs\\"" to describe those who supported impeachment, never even attempting to understand the position of those who supported it.  The author seems to be under Clinton's spell and is unable to look objectively at the man.  The book is also not a true biography in that it covers only a portion of the president's life and leaves out many important issues he faced during his presidency.<br /><br />This book is only for the die hard Clinton fan.

Also, the narrative style of this series is impossible to follow if you are actually hiking. You can't very well head down the trail with your nose in the book, or you risk missing the very wonders the author is so aptly describing.

I've had this edition for a while and was impressed with the quality of the writing and background information.  Since I know Istanbul pretty well and have a copy of the Lonely Planet Istanbul guide, I never really paid attention to the Rough Guide's usefulness \\""in the field.\\""     I just came back from Cappadocia and found the Rough Guide to be wholly inadequate.  The guide is devoid of maps for important cities and compared to the Lonely Planet this is a major weaknesses.  Even in a city like Goreme, which is the base camp for all trips to Cappadocia, the guide contains no maps for restaurants, hotels, etc.  The hotel we stayed at was listed as a 7 (out of 8 marks), yet did not even meet basic cleanliness standards or consistent hot water (we finally left for another hotel).  Lastly, we were lucky that the Turkish road system is well marked and offers great signs for tourists, because the Rough Guide assumes that everyone will be taking a minibus (a BIG waste of time in rural Turkey) and provides no navigational assistance in the narrative.

Roald Dahl is perhaps one of the MOST likeable of narrators. Modest to a fault and blessed with a very sly and subtle sense of humor, the story Dahl tells in GOING SOLO, his sequel to BOY, is perhaps one of the most readable memoirs of modern times. His story of the quick and almost informal training he received at a flying school in Africa shortly after Great Britain entered WWII, is hair-raising and nearly impossible to believe, except you do believe, because you trust this man. At six foot six inches tall, Dahl was physically quite unsuited to be a fighter pilot, noting that when seated in the various planes he flew, his knees were nearly under his chin and he had to hunch over to fit beneath the plane's canopy. But fly he did, even after surviving one horrific crash in the desert early on in his career as an RAF pilot. He sustained a very bad concussion (which was to come back to haunt him and finally \\""invalid\\"" him out of service nearly two years later) and had his face bashed in. As he explained to his mother in a letter: \\""My nose was bashed in ... and the ear nose and throat man pulled my nose out of the back of my head and shaped it and now it looks just as before except that it's a little bent about ...\\"" Dahl went on to fly many combat missions in North Africa and Greece, usually against vastly superior odds, but somehow he managed to survive until the middle of 1941, when the migraine headaches caused by the aforementioned crash made him unfit for further flying. Dahl's nearly laconic and completely unself-conscious manner of writing about the things he did - absolutely heroic things - made me think of Sam Hynes's WWII memoir of his missions in the Pacific theater. Both writers downplay the importance of their roles. They never speak of heroics or derring-do, only about the importance of their comrades, doing the jobs they were trained to do and trying their best to simply stay alive. This was an enormously satisfying, moving and often hilarious tale. After reading these two slim volumes of memoirs by Dahl, I do wish he had written another.

I have already seen it twice in the theatre. The film is based on the 2004 novel LET ME IN by John Ajvide Lindqvist, which has been re-published as LET THE RIGHT ONE IN. After viewing the film twice, I knew the next logical step for me was to read the film novel. I knew that there was a good chunk of information that wasn't included in the film since filmmaker wanted to focus more on the relationship between Eli and Oskar.<br /><br />LET THE RIGHT ONE IN is about 12 year old Oskar Eriksson, a young boy who lives in the working class neighborhood of Blackberge, Sweden. He is a loner with very few friends, if you really call the other children in his life \\""friends\\"". He is constantly tormented by three of his peers at school. John does a wonderful job of bringing to life Oskar's pain at being bullied. The scene of Oskar with the tree in the courtyard really says it all about Oskar's torment.<br /><br />One night, a mysterious man named Hakan and a young girl named Eli moves into Oskar's apartment building. With this recent addition, trouble eventually follows and would consume Blackberge and the rest of Sweden. One night while outside venting out his frustration and pain, Oskar has a brief encounter with Eli. Their initial encounter is brief and both children are wary of each other although it is obvious that Oskar wants to be friends with Eli. As time progresses, Eli and Oskar gets to know each other and eventually becomes friends. It doesn't take the reader very long to realize that Eli isn't what she appears to be but despite what Eli is, Oskar still wants to be around Eli which I found to be rather touching.<br /><br />I loved the John Ajvide Lindqvist novel. His storytelling was both bleak and hopeful. He breathed new life into a tiresome genre. I like how the story goes beyond just being a vampire/horror novel and gets right into the soul of the main characters. I enjoyed reading about the true nature of the relationship between Hakan (Eli's adult companion) and Eli. It was a bit disturbing to say the very least. Even though the book at times came off as a character study, there were still plenty of moments in the story that reminded the reader that this is also a horror novel. I personally could not find any flaws with the book. I enjoyed it for what it really is pure entertainment.

Like when she had the talent of singer/songwriter Griffin Peterson write a 7 song album that went with her book Maybe Someday. This is one of the many things I love about Colleen Hoover. She brings all these different disciplines of artistic abilities together. Writing is an art, just like painting and songwriting; bringing these different aspects of art together and supporting other artists is pretty amazing to me. These collaborations are beautifully done and Colleen Hoover is a pretty awesome trend setter. I would very much be in support of more authors taking part in collaborations such as these.<br /><br />I love books that have a connection to the art world. For me, art is an extremely intimate and personal expression; I suppose as an artist myself I find a connection in characters that are artists. Owen Gentry is an artist that beautifully paints the confessions of others. Although, I should say that the artist Danny O'Connor's paintings are beautiful. Within the book you will find images of paintings mentioned in the book; adding a unique and intimate element to the story.<br /><br />I was able to create a personal connection with Auburn that caused me to understand so very much of what it was she was feeling. The situation she finds herself in is one that she never could have predicted or been prepared for. She is a young woman doing all that she can to be the best person she can for those she loves. As for Owen, he is doing the same thing. Protecting those he loves. The two of them realize that while protecting and doing everything they can for everyone else, they have sacrificed so much of themselves. They both begin to contemplate just how much of themselves they have given up, and when to say enough is enough. They find strength and courage in each other that they didn't have before and start to fight for a future that is far better than what they have been living.<br /><br />Writing is an art. An author &#34;paints&#34; a story for her readers, only she uses words instead of the stokes of a paintbrush. Slowly the colors are added, the mood is set, and the final product begins to take form. A completed picture that slowly comes together piece by piece, word by word. Confess paints a story of loss, heartbreak, fear, strength and hope. I read these pages and watched the story of Owen and Auburn come together, both their individual stories and the story they write together. At times there were paint strokes I didn't see coming and it would change the picture in my mind from light to dark.

JUSTICE SOCIETY OF AMERICA: THY KINGDOM COME Part 2 collects issues #13-18 and JUSTICE SOCIETY OF AMERICA Annual #1. There's some good stuff in here, and also some dull stuff. But if you're a JSA fan, you can't really pass this up.<br /><br />The previous trade ([[ASIN:1401216900 Justice Society of America Vol. 2: Thy Kingdom Come, Part 1]]) told of the Kingdom Come Superman's shocking emergence from Starman's creation of a black hole. Naturally, this caused an instant uproar, upsetting the Justice Society, and, even more personally, JSA's chairwoman Power Girl. Power Girl had just had her closest tie to her original world vanish, with the death of the Earth-2 Superman ([[ASIN:1401210600 Infinite Crisis]]). The Kingdom Come (or Earth-22) Kal-El resembles Earth-2's version quite a bit, and Kara is shaken to the core.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the JSA had begun a recruiting drive, fattening its ranks with an assortment of legacy heroes: from Black Lightning's daughter, unimaginatively codenamed \\""Lightning\\""; the new Amazing Man, grandson and heir to the original's self-transmutating abilities, the new Mr. America (an ex-FBI agent and profiler) and, most boringly, FDR's grandson Lance Corporal David Reid (FDR founded the JSA during WWII). And, of course, Jakeem Thunder would pick this time to come back to the JSA (good luck trying to get a room at the crowded JSA brownstone, buddy). Other than FDR's grandson, this glut of new people seems interesting. But *aargh* this means less camera time for my favorites, Jay Garrick, Stargirl, the schizophrenic Starman, and Cyclone.<br /><br />Much of the focus in the prior trade was on the weathered, soul-beaten Kingdom Come Superman, who found a smidgen of hope in the JSA's still being active. He prayed that the JSA may help avert the same bleak future his own world had brought about. Old Supes would be pretty friggin' peeved off if he cracked open this trade.<br /><br />We finally learn what the deal-io is with the serial killer going around incinerating the hearts of superbeings claiming god-like origins. The worrisome news is that this godslayer calls himself Gog, which reminds the suddenly even more concerned Kingdom Come Supes of Magog, who started the domino effect which tragically ended with a devastated Earth-22. Old Kal-El learns that the native Superman had been attacked by Gog more than a year ago. He flies to Metropolis to confer with his younger doppelganger, but before that he chances on Perry White conversing with Jimmy Olsen, and, soon after, Lois Lane. We then become witness to a splash page featuring a mild but pretty cool confrontation between the two Men of Steel (\\""Excuse me. Are you spying on my wife?\\""). Their talk (no, they don't mix it up) is cut off when old Supes hears nefarious doings up in Gotham City, and off the two streak away. In Gotham, they catch the last act of the Greek demigod Hercules getting his you-know-what handed to him by an off-screen Gog, who soon teleports away. The two Supes check on Hercules. He scoffs at them. Bring on the fighty fight.<br /><br />One of the neat things we discover is the disparity in power between the two Supermen. This is demonstrated when Hercules sends our Superman hurtling into a building with one blow, and yet Hercules's same attack barely registers on the Kingdom Come Superman (dude doesn't even budge). The old Superman then calmly traps Hercules's next punch in his hand and proceeds to smite him a bit.<br /><br />The story then goes Gog-heavy. It turns out this Gog walking around, committing murders, is just a precursor to the real thing, which is an honest-to-gosh god. But before that real thing, this Gog picks a fight with the JSA. Normally not a smart thing, but, apparently, this dude is a bad mutha. The last few pages of issue #14 and all of #15 are devoted to an extended brawl, as Gog pretty much pounds on the entire JSA (and this includes the heavy hitters). It ends in the Congo, as the real Gog erupts from the ground, a colossal deity sporting a damn creeepy grin. He announces to one and all that he means well, he comes in peace, blah blah blah. All the usual hooey which sends the superhero radar a-beeping.<br /><br />Except that it seems Gog might actually mean it. He strolls thru Africa, eradicating disease and starvation. The JSA works in shifts, trailing Gog as he does his good works. And then Gog turns his gaze on the JSA and begins to cure what ails 'em. You can probably guess who he focuses on, but one in particular has immediate bearing. Gog says to Power Girl, \\""You are lost. You want to go home.\\"" He opens a whirlpool of space-time thingamafluffy and sends Power Girl thru it. Incrementally, Gog's miracles begin to create a divide between the JSA - those for Gog, those not.<br /><br />This leads us to the Annual, as we find out that the almighty Gog has transported Power Girl to Earth-2, her home world. Except that I thought Earth-2 had stopped existing way back in [[ASIN:1563897504 Crisis on Infinite Earths]], when the multiverse merged into one universe. Except that, now, after the events in [[ASIN:140121486X 52, Vol. 4]], we're back to having 52 parallel universes in DC. But is Earth-2 one of those 52 universes? The Annual doesn't enlighten us, although the first Crisis is acknowledged somewhat with a brief mention of \\""red skies.\\"" Power Girl, who's got to have the most convoluted origin ever, is at first disbelieving but is happy enough to find herself back home and back with her old friends, who should've been erased from history in the first Crisis. But Power Girl's best friend, Helena Wayne, the Huntress, is here and Power Girl helps her take down the Joker, who in this incarnation is old, be-wheelchaired, and wheezing into an oxygen mask, and still Evil with a capital E. The story ends with a twist. As we suspected, something is screwy with this Earth-2.<br /><br />Elsewhere, two graverobbers enter a tomb, only to stumble onto Black Adam, who goes into his \\""Krrakooomm!\\"" act. This is only a three page snippet, but it foreshadows the next story arc, should the present story arc actually finish up.<br /><br />There's some good stuff in JUSTICE SOCIETY OF AMERICA: THY KINGDOM COME Part 2. The Justice Society contains some of my favorite characters ever, and writer Geoff Johns introduces some intriguing newcomers (for some reason, I'm digging Mr. America, maybe because he doesn't have superpowers). If there's a superhero team who could out-family the Fantastic Four, it's the JSA, of which genealogy spans three generations. I also like the scale of the story, with the JSA taking on an all-powerful god and his ever freaky grin. And the awesome Kingdom Come Superman doing his thing in DC's mainstream continuity is a stroke of smarts.<br /><br />But I do think there's fat in this grip of issues. In particular, issues #16, 17 and 18 are exercises in not much going on, a series of running-in-place interludes. Mostly, the JSA members follow Gog as he traipses thru Africa, waiting for him to transform into someone they could righteously stomp on. Issue #18 at least features a growling, nasty-tempered Hawkman and ends on a promising beat, as something ominous finally happens to solidify the old Superman's fears.<br /><br />Even though I don't think writer Geoff Johns brings out his best stuff here, I'm bummed that he's leaving the title after issue #26. Off the top of my head, I can't think of any worthy replacement (maybe James Robinson? Kurt Busiek? Er... Roy Thomas?) Dale Eaglesham turns in his usual very solid artwork, until guest artist Fernando Pasarin steps in and provides stuff that is passable but not as satisfying as Dale's. Even Jerry Ordway, whose pencils I normally like, seems to be off his game (he draws the Annual andthe last 2 pages of issue #18). What's more, Alex Ross's occasional painted interiors (a few panels here and there) continue to provide a jarring effect (but his covers remain earth-shatteringly good). But I'm starting to think of Eaglesham as the definitive JSA illustrator. He just brings these old- and new timers to vivid life.<br /><br />As a bonus, there's Dale Eaglesham's two-paged splash of the entire JSA roster sitting for a Norman Rockwell painting. Pretty nifty.<br /><br />Bring on [[ASIN:1401221661 Justice Society of America: Thy Kingdom Come, Part 3]]. But, by Gog, let's get the conflict going already!a capital E. The story ends with a twist.

This is one of the many hilarious and thoroughly convincing injunctions in To Rise Again at a Decent Hour, a novel I thoroughly enjoyed and admire.  The story of Paul O'Rourke, dentist and obsessive failed romantic, desperately seeing a sense of identity and belonging is both hilarious and heartbreaking.  Paul is an exaggeration or the personification of our 21st century alienation from each other into &#34;virtual&#34; relationships.  He is flummoxed and frustrated by the rules of the game (finding happiness, someone, a permanent place) which always seem just out of reach.<br /><br />Ferris has the courage to make big and bold observations--doubt may not only be more intelligent than faith, it may also be more comforting.  Embracing a tradition of suffering (whether you're a Red Sox Fan or a Jew) is not noble but masochistic.  The former are encouraged to savor victory, the latter life. All are encouraged to doubt.  I am not a bit surprised that To Rise Again is disliked by so many.  While very funny and accessibly written,  tackling big moral questions about the meaning of life or what to do with it  may be off-putting to some. Asking readers to embrace yet another deracinated anti-hero into the literary pantheon is not everyone's idea of a great read.  It is mine though.<br /><br />I was often dazzled by Ferris' ability to balance the big and the small, the micro and the macro.  The author traverses in and out of biblical myth and modern history and religion, sports, pop culture and quite impressively dental and oral hygiene.  It's hard to make use of baseball as a metaphor without seeming hackneyed but Ferris makes it feel authentic and fresh.  The book is not a perfect one.  I found some parts implausible, parts of the section about the Ulm too long or disjointed.  These though are small complaints.  To Rise Again at a Decent Hour does what great novels do best.  It entertains and it hold a mirror to humans that shows us in a paradoxical light that is both more and less flattering.  To Rise Again is a terrific book.to humans that shows us in a paradoxical light that is both more and less flattering.  To Rise Again is a terrific book.","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

I was drawn to the bond market by some of the large corporate bond spreads that have developed during the credit crisis. So I read a few books and a lot of online literature about bond investing. The Richelson's book is by far the best of the books I read. They start out with a pitch for an all bond portfolio. Being a confirmed equity investor, I didn't buy this, but they make a good case and an all bond portfolio might well be suitable for many readers of the book. They then go through the mechanics of bond issuance and sale, and give detailed information on the market for each type of bond from treasuries to agency bonds to munis to investment grade corporates to junk bonds (my personal favorite). Finally they finish up with bond funds, tax considerations, and investment strategies. Their strategies are too conservative for me, but they appear to be very appropriate for someone who doesn't want to put in the effort required to be successful with more risky strategies.       What I really like about the Richelson's book is this. There is a mantra among many bond investment advisors that bonds are too complicated and information on the bond market is too expensive for the individual investor to even dream of tackling bond investment on his own. Like most myths there is a kernel of truth in this. Bond investing is complicated, but I believe it can be mastered by an individual investor if he's willing to put in the necessary work and become conversant with the market. However, most books don't even give the reader a chance to make this decision for himself. They simply assert the truth of the myth, and suggest that the reader buy a vanilla bond fund or come for help to the friendly author's investment firm. The Richelsons, on the other hand, give you all the information you need to investigate the market for each category of bond on your own. For instance, they provide about 60 websiteswith various kinds of information on bonds including the ability to track individual bonds sales and even access offering prospectuses for secondary corporates online. If the reader finds this all to daunting, there is nothing wrong with owning a vanilla bond fund - I own a few myself - or using a good bond investment advisor like the Richelsons. But at least this book lets you make an intelligent decision one way or the other.       Highly recommended.","2008-12-18","2008","Books"

I became interested in this series because I grew up watching Disney movies, listening and reading these fable stories, and did role-playing with the characters as a child. Also because these fables are a part of American childhood culture and I was enthusiastic that the author created a series for adult taste that I can enjoy during this age of my life. I also appreciate art as well. Some fable characters that are in this book are Snow White, Cinderella, the Beauty and the Beast, Jack from the beanstalk fairy tale, the wolf and the three little pigs, and more.<br /><br />All of the fable characters live in a town called Fabletown in New York. It is reclusive to only its fable members. They have been in exile due to a powerful god or woodland sprite called the adversary. The wolf is the detective and he has to find out what happen to Rose Red which is Snow White’s sister. He suspects that she is the victim of violence or possibly homicide or suicide. Snow White works for the government as director of operations. She assists the wolf during most of the investigation.<br /><br />It is very suspenseful and the writing style and illustrations help keep the reader interested. This comic book shows that in reality fairy tales may not happen or as often as we want them to but if we stay diligent and work hard we may be able to reap some rewards in life. I expect for more stories to unfold in the following volumes. You have to read it for yourself and the ending will literally blow your mind. I also like how the illustrator draws flashbacks during some scenes when a person is talking. The story is presented like a movie which is what I love the most. There are also lots of surprises in this book that will have you thinking, “ I didn’t expect that to happen”.  I also like that there is a lot of text in this book. It takes me longer to read this book than it does with another type of comic bookthat is the same amount of pages.<br /><br />The only thing that could have been better is if the characters had been more interesting, unique and developed. But it’s still a 5-star graphic novel to me due to the suspense, humor, plot, writing style, illustrations, and being a feel good comic book!","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

The edition which most people usually think of as the first edition of this dictionary was the only English dictionary which students at the college where I did my freshman and sophomore years of study, in the mid-1960s, were permitted to cite as their lexical authority (the then recently debased \\""Collegiate\\"" dictionary from Merriam-Webster, having been prime among the dictionaries that students were forbidden to use in writing their papers and assignments). There had been forerunners of the supremely fine Webster's New World Dictionary under the same title, published decades before the 1950s, under the imprint of World Publishers, but those earlier ones did not so deserve to be considered the first edition (which seems to have gone through printings from 1954 or so to 1968, of which the one that I first obtained was the 1964 printing).<br /><br />I have acquired and used every edition of this dictionary, right up to and including the fourth and now (updating this review slightly in 2014) the fifth editions. I have retained each much-loved, well-used edition, keeping them in various rooms of my house, along with some other favoured dictionaries, for ready resort near desks, tables, or chairs where I most often read or write. For those who specifically have a preference for the Third Edition, the purchaser from an Amazon WWW site should be aware that Prentice Hall published, for that edition itself (nice to have, but not affecting the overall desirability of it in any major way), a 1994 Update of the Third College Edition in, of course, 1994 (of which the ISBN number for it, \\""thumb-indexed\\"", is 0-671-88243-0, and, \\""plain-edged\\"", is 0-671-88289-9).<br /><br />An interesting feature, by the way, of the Second College Edition, at least of the sturdy \\""Special School Printing\\"" of it which I own, is a flexi-disc (33.3 r.p.m., 7 in.) included with it that bears the title upon it, \\""New World Phonoguide: an Audio Supplement to the Pronunciation Guide and Phonetic Symbols\\"" which could be of considerable help to users for whom English is a second (third, etc.) language. I have not seen this helpful disc in other editions of this dictionary as I own copies of them. As for the fourth college edition, one or some printing(s) of it come(s) with an accompanying CD-ROM.<br /><br />Each edition of the Webster's New World Dictionary has improved on the one that preceded it and one can make a good case especially for any of the Third to Fifth Editions as the one preferred for reasons of content or of sheer attractive format, ease, and presentation (the Third Edition being particularly fine in those regards, remaining quite a viable option to choice over the somewhat more austerely cramped pages of the Fifth Edition). Alas, for some dictionaries, decline, rather than consistently genuine improvement, can set in with their later editions. That is so very notably in the case of those benighted \\""Collegiate\\"" dictionaries from Merriam-Webster, which fell from grace when they began to be based on the excessively permissive Webster's THIRD New International Dictionary (the unabridged dictionary from Merriam-Webster, which had displaced the rock-solid and far more trustworthy Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged SECOND Edition), Earlier and better Merriam-Webster's \\""Collegiate\\"" dictionary editions formerly and more happily had been based, to such good effect, on the Unabridged Second Edition, which had guaranteed a solid foundation. Similar decay also has beset numerous other dictionaries which have not undergone wise or sufficient revision, leading to the lessening of quality or of reliability as later editions appear, when compared to former ones.<br /><br />A single, general-purpose college or desk-reference dictionary, even so admirably aimed at sophisticated adult level as the Webster's New World College Dictionary is, will not suffice to fulfil all requirements. For one thing, a truly unabridged dictionary, usually multi-volume, is good to have around for  exceptional needs; I have several such dictionaries, of which, among them, I particularly commend \\""The Random House Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged\\"", Second Edition, in one humongous and heavily oversized volume (of xlii, 2478, 32 p.). Also, one or a few dictionaries which correspond(s) to Commonwealth usage is (or are) important for non-American readers to possess and to use. Being here in Canada, I tend most to rely upon British dictionaries for spelling (especially Cassell's, Chamber's, and Harrap's fine recent editions of their respective dictionaries) and on specifically Canadian dictionaries (most notably the impeccable Gage dictionaries) for pronunciation or for peculiarly Canadian use and origin, but for definitions, I always have preferred the best American dictionaries, especially the various editions of Webster's New World Dictionary.<br /><br />The Amazon buyer cannot go wrong in purchasing any variant of the Webster's New World Dictionary. If he cannot afford or find the latest edition, any of the previous \\""college\\"" editions is quite suitable and reliable for everyday use.

This is just being intellectually lazy.    The other fault I take issue with is his nearly non-stop misanthropic rant against those who have made poor decisions or fail to see the TRUTH as clearly as he does.

As such he is certainly a cut above the workers, and has spent his time learning the fine art of knighthood, including how to run in armor and knock a man off his horse with a lance. Above the aristocracy are the 'hoppers', kangaroo like creatures that have exclusive rights to technology like cars and planes.  Sir Howard enjoys the respect he is give by the workers and does not mind saluting in his turn to the 'hoppers'.  That is the order and way of doing things that God has ordained after all.  As a last fling before he settles down the young Sir Howard sets of on a journey to nowhere in particular in search of adventure.  He soon meets Lyman Haas from Wyoming, an unorthodox fellow skilled in the use of rope lassoing.  Together they set out to rescue Sally Mitten, a beautiful young woman who has been detained by a local warlord.  Amid all this adventure Sir Howard is sure that the world is as it should be, but is that really so?  Events will soon conspire to make him think, and think deeply.<br /><br />The first part of this novella has a distinct feel of fantasy, as if one was reading some weird alternate history.  The combination of medieval society with technology is most intriguing.  Then about halfway through the tale 'explanations' are given and the story changes into pure science fiction.  Thematically the story is about order in society, particularly through political systems, and what is the best method of doing this.  Showing some depth of thought De Camp touches on the possibility of a democratic world government for Planet Earth, but ultimately this book is a celebration of the 'twentieth century American way' of doing things.  De Camp does not even mention the great Soviet experiment, which was well under way by the time this tale was written.  The work consists of only 14 short chapters, which does not leave much room for development, but De Camp does manage to swing a complete revolution of though for Sir Howard.  The author, however, is at his very best when describing rollicking adventure, as he does in the first half, rather than when he is being philosophical.  This adventure of course contains a dash of De Camp's trademark humor to jolly us through the story.  Considering this novella was last revised in 1948 it is interesting that we can read it in the twenty first century without feeling that it is a 'quaint old tale'.  It is, indeed, an amusing read perfectly suited to an occasion when you have a day free to read, but don't want to start on a long novel.<br /><br />The Stolen Dormouse: the company is all<br /><br />The year is 2236 and the influence of business companies has greatly increased.  The company is all: one lives in the company building, dresses in company uniform, works for the same company all ones life, and is even born into the company.  An individual might even fight a duel with a member of another company if they have insulted your corporation strongly enough.  In this world Horace Juniper-Hallett has made the mistake of feeling romantically inclined towards Janet Bickam-Coates.  Janet works for the Stromberg Company and Horace for Crosley Company.  These two businesses are bitter competitors and there has been a feud between them for so long that nobody can remember what the original cause was.  In the mayhem that follows Horace is kicked right out of the Crosely Company, but Archwin Taylor-Thing, chairman of Crosley, has a proposition for Horace.  Recently a 'dormouse', an engineer in a state of suspended animation, has disappeared from the mausoleum where he is kept and Archwin is convinced that the Strombergs have something to do with it.  If he is revived the dormouse might have valuable information that could turn a pretty profit.  If Horace could solve this mystery of the stolen dormouse he of course would bereinstated to the company and even marked for future promotion.<br /><br />This novella has a feudal ethos, which makes it an idea companion to &lt;Divide and Rule>.  De Camp has taken the idea of the 'clan company' from Japan where it is an actual reality, though it has been embellished a little to make the story more fun.  The tale is written with a distinct tongue in cheek atmosphere, though it also contains much action and adventure.  The reader is soon caught up in wondering exactly what will happen next and how things will all end for Horace.  This novella is not weighed down by philosophy, as &lt;Divide and Rule> is, but has less character development.

It's structure is very well thought-out and logical, so that the reader with even less knowledge of poetry than I have should have no trouble in getting all the way through the book.<br /><br />\\""Poetry for Dummies\\"" looks very well at all the major movements in the history of poetry, from Romanticism to the Beats and discusses such classic foreign forms as the haiku of Japan. It does so in a manner that is exceptionally easy to read and comprehend, and there is the added bonus of instructions of how to write poetry in any style from the most rigid to the freest verse. It even explains how these structures evolved and how free verse itself is extremely ancient though only revived quite recently.<br /><br />A bonus is the quiz at the front and lists of \\""Ten Poems Worth Memorising\\"" and \\""Ten Love Poems\\"" at the back that will further help the poetry novice understand poetry. The selection is good enough to be regarded as fair: it is not like they are selecting the latest, most politically correct poetry as the [[ASIN:1596980117 PIGs]] would have you believe: there is a poem by Shakespeare for a start and several others from the classic canon.<br /><br />Even if not perfect for the expert, \\""Poetry for Dummies\\"" satisfies all the requirements for people trying to grasp a complex artform.","2008-12-18","2008","Books"

Once I recovered from the intimidating thump that HEADSTATIC made when I slid it from the envelope and onto my coffee table, the next striking trait had to be its impressive variety of style and subject, all flowing from the same creator.<br /><br />  Hacker employs all sorts of techniques: traditional pen and ink, collage, modifying photographs, loose cartooning, realism, tracing found images... he's very experimental and not content to settle into a style that is comfortable for him. Moreover, the backgrounds and layouts display an incredible diversity as well; it's almost hard to believe that one man did them all.<br /><br />  As to the content, it doesn't take long for Hacker to establish a fairly consistent voice, a quirky and meditative attitude toward his subjects. Much of the humor derives from juxtaposition and non-sequitur (witness titles like \\""Hybrid Baby vs. Ghost Mouse\\"" and \\""The Caped Crustacean and the Supermodel\\""; or the comic \\""Goosebumps\\"", which relates the tale of Fabio being hit in the head by a migrating goose while riding a roller coaster. Fabio's hands are telling the story with shadow-puppets on the wall - and they seem to argue a lot.) Not all of Hacker's comics are as silly as these though; many of them deal with weightier issues of love, mortality, or general existential ennui, and no genre remains untouched.<br /><br />  The most appropriate one-word summary for HEADSTATIC would be \\""wow\\"". Impressiveness of size aside, this collection really runs the gamut, and I've rarely seen a single artist put his hand to such a variety of subjects with so much success. The price tag may be unusually high, but this is a handsomely-produced comic with a nice, professional appearance. And really, this book is his life so far! Twelve dollars is not an unreasonable amount to pay when you get such a high return.<br /><br />  My one complaint is that HEADSTATIC could really use a comprehensive foreword by Hacker himself, only to place some of his work in context. I'd love to have known how old he is, how long he's been making comics, where and how he has brought his work to people in the past, and what span of time is represented in the book. A brief afterword by one of his friends indicates that one of the series reprinted in HEADSTATIC originally appeared in their college paper, but I want more! It's just such a lot of creative output that it seems to demand a little history lesson. Maybe it's just me.<br />Matt Fagan<br /><br />  Perusing the pages of Headstatic immediately gives the impression that this anthology is comprised of a variety of authors and artists, all providing unique material. But readers will doubletake when they discover that Jay A. Hacker III is the sole author of this collection, which includes over two hundred pages of short pieces that vary drastically in content and artistic style. Beyond stating that he focuses on a grayscale, using more black and white than anything else, few definitive statements can be made about his work, which defies categories and stereotypes. It shifts from text-laden panels to text-free stories in which the picture tells all. Some pieces make absolute sense while others feel more surreal than an Andre Breton film.<br /><br />The title, Headstatic, perfectly defines the resulting effect of this graphic novel. Inundated with dozens of short pieces, readers of this anthology will often simultaneously be ecstatic and feel like they have static in their heads. Numerous stories force the reader to think and engage in the story. The static comes from a sense of overload. Short pieces though they may be, this graphic novel is best processed in small chunks. Reading from beginning to end will only send the brain into a frenzy akin to the static white screen of a television. But that's only because there is so much to contend with in terms of themes, style, narrative, and genre, that to read it in one sitting is to guarantee missing something.<br /><br />Of course, Hacker's work can be overwhelming and at times feel more erratic than anything else. Chaos is probably the one definitive attribute in most of his pieces whether it be in the art, dialogue, action, or theme. While some can easily appreciate this, others will be disaffected, even disturbed by it. If this graphic novel is a snapshot into the Hacker's mind, one cannot help but be amazed by the onslaught of emotion and energy he puts into his art. Not all readers will be so vehement and awestruck by his work, but none would disagree about Hacker's sheer effort.<br />Lance Victor Eaton<br /><br />Jay Hacker's Headstatic from Fool's Child Comix is a massive, massive slab of comics. A Xeric Award winner, Hacker has compiled five years worth of his comic strips into a big graphic novel for a measly twelve bucks. Some strips are more successful than others, but he does a mean homage to a number of different cartoonists and is definitely reaching out to see what the boundaries of his talent are. Headstatic is the type of thing I'd love to see more of from more starting cartoonists, because it gives you such a great feel for what they're capable of and what they're thinking about their art.<br />Alan David Doanewhite screen of a television.

Even though it's basically a condensed version of the author's Manhunt: The 12-Day Chase for Lincoln's Killer, this book (targeted primarily at a teenaged reader market) is still chock full of little-known facts and tidbits about this most seminal of events in American history.  Obviously, John Wilkes Booth dominates the narrative, but I was most interested in what the author had to say about the other individuals (Dr. Samuel Mudd and Mary Surratt in particular) tried and sentenced for their involvement in the conspiracy.  There have always been some who make the claim for Dr. Mudd's innocence, while the hanging of Mary Surratt, a woman (obviously), has long been controversial as well.  James Swanson does a nice job of explaining the involvement of both, leaving little room for doubt that these two were involved to a significant degree, before and after the fact.<br /><br />Like many Americans, I have stood in Ford's Theatre looking over at the booth where Abraham Lincoln was shot, and I've stood in the room of the Petersen House where he died several hours later (I hope that the author's surprising statement that most visitors to Ford's Theatre do not venture across the street to the Petersen House is not true).  The solemnity of those moments is a far cry from the panic and bedlam of the crowds on that night, and Swanson's description of the latter gives one a whole new perspective on the events of that night.  You witness, through the pages of this book, the surreal horror of Dr. Charles A. Leale, one of America's great unsung heroes, dislodging a clot of blood from the hole in Lincoln's head (to relieve pressure on the brain) and slinging it to the ground from his blood fingers - in front of hundreds of onlookers - even as he valiantly tries to find some quiet place the President can pass his final hours.  This is followed by the evocative image of Lincoln, being carried inside a blanket, appear in an almost Christ-like way as he is being passed up to the second level of the Petersen house, giving the crowd below an unforgettable final image of the mortally wounded man.<br /><br />One also tends to forget that Lincoln was not the only target for assassination on that night.  Vice President Johnson's assigned killer chickened out (but was still hanged with 3 other co-conspirators), while a staggering display of violence and bravery played out inside the home of Secretary of State Seward.  The story of the conspirators' individual captures makes for truly fascinating reading, as mere stupidity and lack of planning led several of them to the gallows or life in prison.  Then, of course, there is the story of Booth's desperate race south, a race that took twelve days to play out before the assassin was finally cornered and killed at Garret's farm.  You just don't get the full story in the history books.  It is a story that begins some time before April 14, 1865, as Booth's original plan was to kidnap the President and take him to Richmond.  There is much damning evidence of Samuel Mudd to be found in this part of the story.ing carried inside a blanket, appear in an almost Christ-like way as he is being passed up to the second level of the Petersen house, giving the crowd below an unforgettable final image of the mortally wounded man.

The illustrations Arthur Rackham made for this classic in 1915, with mostly lithe figures and spare coloring do great justice to the tale of an elderly miser, who, on the anniversary of his business partner's death on Christmas Eve, is forced to review his life, and is offered a final chance for redemption.    The tale of Ebenezer Scrooge could be viewed as an early novel of spiritual psychoanalysis.    After readers learn of Scrooge's character flaws--his stinginess, his cold-hearted attitude towards people, including a nephew and his wife, who are his only family--he is confronted by the ghost of his business partner, Jacob Marley, who, despite Scrooge's reluctance, shows him his long chain, explains its significance, and warns him to amend his ways.     Scrooge is visited by three spirits--the first being the child-like, white-haired Ghost of Christmas Past, who makes Scrooge retrace his steps in life, causing him to review a harsh and lonely childhood, which is tempered by consolation from his loving but ill-fated sister, Fan, his happier years as an apprentice to a man named Fezziwig, and finally, he recognizes how his singular pursuit of wealth at all costs resulted in the loss of his fiancee, Belle.     The Ghost of Christmas Present is the most joyous and festive of the apparitions.Sitting in a well-lit room at a table with a glorious bounty when he first encounters Scrooge, he escorts his elderly charge through London,  where he sees the spirit of the season among the people, and  visits the houses of his employee, Bob Cratchit, and that of his nephew, Fred. He learns of the plight of Cratchit's son, Tiny Tim, discovers how he is viewed in both households, is shown the impact of poverty among those whom he has the potential to help, and lastly warned about the consequences of Want and Ignorance.   The third spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come, is the darkest, most foreboding of the phantoms. It is hooded, faceless, and silent as it shows the old man the possible future, pointing to significant details with a clammy hand as Scrooge realizes that he has reaped what he has sown.      Back in his bed at the end of a chilling night's journey, Scrooge sees the potential to be a better man than before. He has come to terms with his past, learns to rejoice in the present, and to create a better future for those around him.    Ebenezer...In Hebrew, the name means \\""Stone of Help\\"", which may well be why Dickens chose it for one of his most famous characters.In the end, a formerly miserly old man does a fine job of becoming just that!","2008-12-18","2008","Books"

I say that because it's true (and not only because I grew up across the alley from the old Clayton homestead in Parsons, Kansas; Buck's mother used to cut my mom's hair and I'd tag along when I was three or four, not knowing that, really, 2313 Grand could be thought of as a shrine to a great musician who'd long-since left town and made his way to fame).  True, the jazz-fan reader will especially love this once Buck returns to California (after an adventure riding boxcars west, he'd returned home to graduate high school) and begins his climb to success--the names of great jazzers fall like spring rain.  But Parsonians will truly cherish the long first chapter, in which Buck recounts his adventures and exploits growing up--it's a mini-history of life for a young black man in the early twentieth century in a small Kansas town (not far from Ft. Scott, and Gordon Parks's great book \\""The Learning Tree\\"") and his eye for detail (and, of course, his splendid storytelling) brings back a lost world.  Few will know that W.E.B. Dubois came to Parsons--and stayed with the Claytons--to organize supporters and make speeches in southeast Kansas; I sure didn't, but it's all here, all this and much, much more, beautifully told.","2008-12-18","2008","Books"

Debi Pearl explains from every angle this difficult and controversial subject, all the while calling her readers to trust our loving God who created us and wants the very best for us.  If you are not prepared to read this book to the very end you WILL misunderstand her views!  I have read and spoken to several women who made this mistake.  They quit too early because they read something that \\""rubbed them wrong\\"" and formed opinions of Debi Pearl that were incorrect.  Keep reading and she will explain herself further- many times bringing the balance to statements that seem to overly simplify difficulties in marriage.    For me personally this book has been a help beyond explanation.  Although I wanted to throw it across the room several times, in the end I left encouraged to trust God and hopeful that no matter what obstacles I face in my marriage, He can work miracles to get me and my husband through them.  And not just through them- better because of them.    One last note to those who have said this book puts all of the responsibility on women:  Debi makes it clear that this is a book for women only.  She is writing as though your husband will do nothing on his end to help solve your marriage troubles.  I feel this is extremely wise, and, more often than not, true to life.  Most marriages I see in extreme turmoil are not there because both partners are trying to work on things.  Usually one person has completely given up and the other is barely hanging on.  This book gives hope to that woman- the one whose husband doesn't care anymore.  She calls to that desparate woman, \\""Hang on!  God can still turn your marriage around!\\""      She hit my issues right on the head and every principle I have applied from this book has worked and blessed my husband AND myself.  Give it a chance- if it doesn't work you can always go back to doing things your old way...","2008-12-18","2008","Books"

Sorrowful and desolate the hero in this novel sets the stage for this story but even amidst his despair there is a glimmer of hope.  This novel is incredibly well written full of passion, innocence, debauchery and adventure.    Gabriel St. Croix is a male prostitute living in Paris, working at a brothel. He is desperate to save a child brought into the bordello from his own fate.  For five years he has protected James and now his brother and sister are there to redeem him.  Gabriel is stunned when he is offered a place in James's household as a companion.  He accepts as a means to escape a lonely life.    Lady Sara Munroe, young widow and unconventional countess is very grateful that Gabriel saved her little brother from the horrors of child prostitution.  When he comes back to the manor with the family, Sarah is determined to break through his defensive walls. She constantly extends her hand in friendship but is coldly rebuffed.    This changes when Gabriel discovers her love of astronomy and in an innocent gesture Sara invites him to view the stars with her on her balcony.  Slowly, Gabriel opens up about his sordid past and it is devastating to the Countess and the reader.  Gabriel is so broken that the reader cannot help but feel his agony.  Gabriel falls madly in love with Sarah and she too feels the same way.  There are very moving scenes between these two filled with so much passion just from a kiss or hand holding.    Gabriel is a master musician and can read and write fluently in a couple of languages.  He is self taught and because he makes his own way he insists on providing financially for Sara.  This takes him aboard a privateering ship and from there all manner of problems ensue during a stormy sea.  Gabriel finds himself imprisoned and he is desperate for Sara.  The scenes here are raw and violent, well written and fluid.    I never really wanted this novel to end it was that good.  Iread it in one day.  Gabriel is more than a tortured hero, he is tormented but hopeful.  Sara's devotion is a healing balm but there is still that incredibly vulnerable side to his personality that peeps through now and again.  Sara is a worthy heroine; honorable, kind, forgiving and nonjudgmental she is the perfect mate for Gabriel.  This is a keeper and I look forward to Ms. James next novel.","2008-12-18","2008","Books"

In addition, as Mr Thomas writes, the question he kept asking was \\""whether Nixon could see the true Nixon\\"".  Nixon's strenghts were his weaknesses, and vice versa. The drive that propelled him also crippled him. The underdog's sensitivity that made him farsighted also blinded him. He wanted to show that he was hard because he felt soft. He learned how to be popular because he felt rejected. He was the lonely everyman to the end.<br />In this fascinating and gripping biography, the author peels away all the layers of this complex man who eventually would become the 37th President of the USA, showing the so many contradictions of his personality. To his merit one should mention the detente with the USSR, the establishment of diplomatic relations with China and the ending ot the Vietnam War. Watergate was Nixon's own graveyard as a result of his hubris.<br />This is a very insightful history and biography of a man who always showed optimism, written in a very dynamic style.

Soccer tryouts are also that exact same day, which Jack just cannot for the life of him miss.  Instead of heading home and taking his medicine like he's supposed to, he goes to soccer.  While being there, he runs into his \\""bully\\"" Garrett, who's name screams \\""I'm a bully, that's how it's supposed to be\\"", who Jack literally \\""gives Garret a taste of his own medicine (no pun intended) without even touching him!\\"".

Although this story is given a Harry Potter feel right off the bat, it does develop into something different.  Although the characters seem to have emotions like a broken TV remote, the story still moves along at a steady pace and keeps the action coming.  The book is highly predictable and really clichéd, unfortunately.  If you want a book that's completely different and flat out unique, pick up a different one.  This book is great for fantasy lovers, but it's nothing special.  Overall, this is an underdeveloped book.","2008-12-18","2008","Books"

This man can write and, as the chief historian of the National Park Service, he is an author who knows his topics well. But whatever possessed him to write a biography about a Native American from the Native American point of view, I will never understand. To write a biography about a Native American from the Native American point of view, by definition you have to be a Native American. He is not and that is where this book falls down.    Sitting Bull is a fascinating individual. Caught in the very short transition period between his people's traditional way of life and the tidal wave of technological change the white man represented, he performs quite brilliantly in defending his environment, his people and the Sioux culture. Utley does a very good job of communicating this to his audience.     But he goes too far in trying to become Native American. The results are that the background descriptions become almost mystical while the Native American cultural analysis is clunky, cumbersome. As a result, Utley alienates his reader, the very person he is trying to communicate with, with a book that is, well, quite boring in many sections. And that is a shame because the writing style chosen ultimately detracts from an interesting and important topic, Sitting Bull.    There is no doubt that this is a scrupulously well researched biography about a very key leadership figure in the history of the American West. In the end however, I didn't really feel I knew much more about Sitting Bull the man after I had finished reading it. In the end Sitting Bull remains aloof and mysterious, a mythical figure that simply failed as opposed to the focused warrior facing an uncertain future that he had to have been.","2008-12-18","2008","Books"

I had an opportunity to see his crusade in Oklahoma City in 2003 as I was traveling between Houston and OKC for business during that time period. But a delayed flight brought me into town too late for the last night of his crusade. I regret that I missed that one last opportunity to see him preach in person.    This unauthorized, true story of a young Graham is told in a series of flashback scenes to a reporter (Deborah Matthews), through the eyes of the popular evangelist and friend, Charles Templeton. Matthews is sent to Templeton's bedside, hospitalized in his early 80's with Alzheimer's for one purpose: get the dirt on Graham.    From the start of their interview, Templeton makes it known that there is absolutely no dirt to be found when it comes to Billy Graham. \\""He's the genuine article. He actually believes all that stuff he preaches,\\"" as Templeton says it. Her editor will not accept her assertion that there is no scandal to dig up and she is told to either come up with one or she will be given her walking papers.    Billy begins in 1934, portraying Graham as a happy sixteen year old whose greatest wish was to be a baseball player. Although raised in a Christian family, Graham has some cynical views about evangelists. This all changed as he showed up to hear Dr. Mordecai Ham in a tent revival and ended up committing his life to God.    The book then covers his meeting Ruth Bell at Wheaton College, their courtship and eventually them being married in August, 1943. It describes how Templeton and Graham worked together in Youth for Christ rallies. Despite Templeton's success, he grows skeptical and finds himself at a crossroads - a crisis of his faith. He found himself plagued with doubts and questions. The unanswered questions eventually led Templeton to leave the ministry because he no longer could preach a Bible he didn't believe in.Graham is crushed by Templeton's decision and eventually starts down the path of questioning his own commitment. The outcome of his struggle is far different than that of Templeton. That leads to Graham becoming one of the greatest evangelists in modern day history.    I personally enjoyed the book very much. It is well written in my opinion. I learned things about Graham that I had ever known - that he was a Fuller Brush salesman or that he was a college president. It reminded me of things that I had previously read, but had forgotten - like his wife, Ruth, was the daughter of missionary parents and planned to serve God in that manner, and never planned to marry. Through all the various stories about his beginning, it is very exciting to see God work in a man who never really sought the greatness that he was later afforded.    If you have previously read books about Billy Graham and are afraid this one will be a repeat - I advise you to get the book and read it. You will enjoy it.","2008-12-18","2008","Books"

Many times mistakes can be quietly corrected, with no one the wiser.  When you are the President of the United States, those mistakes or errors in judgment can have long lasting repercussions.  Thomas Craughwell gives the reader a very easily understanding of many of the American President's most-misguided efforts over the last two centuries.<br /><br />Each chapter follows the pattern of proving a historic context for the Presidential error.  With the context in place, Craughwell then steps the reader through the thought process the President followed at the time.  He then provides an analysis of both the short-term and long-term effects of the mistakes.  In many instances, it was fascinating to see that the historic context for one chapter fed right into the next.  As an example, the \\""Alien and Sedition Acts\\"" of President John Adams, was initiated in response to perceived French plots to subvert the United States.  Not only did it irritate the French, leading to conflict during Jefferson's presidency, Craughwell posits the \\""Alien and Sedition Acts\\"" led to the discrediting and downfall of the Federalist party.  The Federalist's roughshod treatment of the First Amendment and subsequent downfall, stands as a great lesson unlearned for the modern Republican Party.<br /><br />There are many nuggets of conveniently forgotten American embarrassments in the book, including some that have never made it into public school history books.  Many American's know about the effort to colonize Liberia with freed slaves.  Craughwell studies Ulysses S. Grant's proposal to annex the island of Santo Domingo as a refuge for Black Americans during the \\""Reconstruction Era\\"".<br /><br />Overall, I found Craughwell's book to be enlightening and more importantly, written in engaging prose that the average reader can comprehend and will want to continue reading.  The chapters can be read independently, which was a definite plus if you are a reader that has a tendency to put a book down for a few days between chapters.<br /><br />My only complaint is that Craughwell is unfairly critical of President Bush's invasion of Iraq.  Comparing Roosevelt's policy to place the innocent Japanese American's into protective enclaves with the internment of enemy combatants at Guantanamo Bay is not only premature, it is academically irresponsible.  It is unfortunate that his personal opinion, which is completely unsubstantiated by any quoted source in this work, taints this otherwise outstanding work.<br /><br />He does offer a relatively unbiased review of President Bush's decision to invade Iraq.  However, again, he does not offer any source to substantiate his opinions of why Bush invaded Iraq.  Craughwell quotes Zhou En Lai's response of \\""Too soon to tell\\"" to Henry Kissinger's question about the impact of the 1789 French Revolution.  He goes on to state \\""In the lame duck months of Bush's presidency, in the midst of an election campaign, and with his popularity ratings cratering, by En-lai's reckoning, it is at least 200 years too soon to assess Bush's impact on history, and especially the Iraq invasion.\\""  Craughwell certainly got that right.  My personal opinion is that all wars are terrible, and this one is far too recent to offer an objective opinion on President Bush's decision to invade.<br /><br />This book would be a welcome addition to any reader of American History.  It should be mandatory reading for any government employee who establishes or influences American foreign and domestic policy.ew days between chapters.

There was a big problem.  She was not virgin.  The mother forced the bride to confess the name of the man responsible of her loss of honor.  The two older twin brothers of the bride told everyone they met that they were going to kill with knives the man responsible.  Even though many people knew of the threat, no one warned the man, and the brothers killed him.  However, the investigation following the death reveals that there many questions.  The narrator of the story was in the town when his friend was killed.  The narrator returns to the town 27 years later.  He remembers some things, and asks others what they remember.  Although we readers already know the who, what, where, when, and why the death occurred, the narrator makes us see questions inside of questions and mysteries inside of mysteries.  These questions and mysteries will be investigated completely, but at the end of the investigation there will be no absolute truth.    Maybe this would be a good time to discuss the influence of some aspects of the social ambience.  The period in time of the death was after the First World War, and subsequently, 27 years later.  The place was a town of medium size in Colombia along the Caribbean shore some distance from the big cities such as Cartagena, Santa Marta, and Barranquilla.  The town was a bit backward and the people somewhat traditional.  For example, a bride was imagined to be virgin the night of her wedding.  However, only the women had to be so virtuous.  In this story, the men, including the twin brothers of the bride, could go to the local whore house, that the author calls \\""the house of mercies of Maria Alejandrina Cervantes\\"".  Nowadays, these attitudes seem curious, silly and oppressive.  But not in this time and place -- that inequality of the expectations between the sexes is essential to the story.    Of course, not every woman still had her hymen when she married.  Perhaps she had a previous lover.  But more likely in that era, she had broken the hymen during some physical activity.  In either case, she would have had to do something clever such as stain the sheet with tomato sauce or mercurochrome.  If she had not done this, there would have been big problems.  Unfortunately, the bride in this story was a little stupid.  In spite of the counsel of her female friends, she did not do something clever.  Her lack of action resulted in the fatal consequence to the man supposedly responsible.      The story has various principal characters.  One is the narrator, who refers to himself simply as \\""I \\"".   When he speaks of his own thoughts and memories, he speaks in the first person.  However, when telling the story, and he speaks about the thoughts and memories of others, he uses the third person combined with dialog.  At times he speaks at the time of the events.  At other times he speaks from a point of view 27 years later.      The novel has five parts.  Each part is not a typical chapter where the story is developed in a chronological sequence.   In this novel each part is the same story is told accentuating the perspective of one or more persons and the roles of various persons.                       In the first part the narrator speaks of the man who was killed, Santiago Nasar, his mother, his father, his cook, and other people in his life.  The reader learns that he is the descendent of Arab Christians, that he has land and wealth, and that he is macho.  Also, in the first part the reader learns all of the basic information of \\""who done it\\"".      In the second part Bayard San Román, the man who retuned his bride, is presented.  This part also tells of the people involved in his life such as his fiancé and her family.  He is a man of mystery, buthe is also rich and handsome.  The reader receives more details about the death and the roles of other people of the town.    The third part speaks of the twin brothers of the bride, their lives, their threats and actions on the morning of the death, why Santiago Nasar was not warned, and why the death was not prevented.  Of particular interest is that neither the mayor (the government) nor the priest (the church) could prevent the death even though both knew about the threat.  Does the failure of these two agents suggest the failure of the institutions that they represent?     The fourth part includes the autopsy, the funeral, the trial of the twin brothers, and the subsequent lives of some of the people most important to the story.  There is a terrible scene with the dogs of the home of Satiago Nasar.  Before leaving his house for the last time, the cook was dressing some rabbits.  Santiago Nasar objected when the cook tossed the entrails to the dogs.  Later that morning after being butchered by the twins, Santiago Nasar stumbles into the kitchen with his intestines on the floor.  The air is heavy with the smell of human flesh and excrement.  The dogs try to eat the entrails.  This scene graphically invokes the Biblical admonition in Philippians 3:2 to \\""Watch out for those dogs, those men who do evil, those mutilators of the flesh.\\"" This scene and the scene of the autopsy make this chapter horrific.       The texture of the narration changes in the fifth part when it becomes a serial chronicle of the events.  The principle person is Cristo Bedoya, another friend of Santiago Nasar.  Bedoya learns that the twins are going to kill Nasar, and he takes the threat seriously.  Bedoya is the only person that acts with urgency to find Nasar and prevent the death.  But in spite of his efforts, he does not succeed.       As the story progresses, the role of each person, and his contribution to the confluence of events, becomes clear.  There are more than 50 people that are mentioned including Colonel Aureliano Buendía, who actually is a character from another Gabriel García Márquez (GGM) novel.  Some people are of great importance.  Others are only of minor importance.  Some people agreed with the brothers.  Other heard about the brother but did not take the threat seriously.  Still other tried to warn Santiago Nasar but could not find him.  However, each person and his actions are spun into a thread that is subsequently woven into a fine tapestry by GGM.     One personal hallmark of a GGM novel is the first sentence that joins several short ideas into a long and complicated train of thought that is both curious and mysterious.  So the first sentence of A Chronicle of a Death Foretold appears as \\""On the day they were going to kill him, Santiago Nasar got up at 5:30 in the morning to wait for the boat that the bishop was coming on.\\""  Santiago Nasar would be killed by some people.  He got up early.  The bishop would arrive by boat.  We learn how all these things are brought together as the story develops.  But compare this first sentence with those of two other GGM novels.  In Love in the Time of Cholera we read, \\""It was inevitable: the smell of bitter almonds always reminded him of the fate of unrequited love\\"".  And what is perhaps the most famous first sentence of the 20th Century from A Hundred years of Solitude, \\""Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.\\""  Obviously, these first sentences are the hallmark of a master writer.    Another personal hallmark of GGM is the use of what is called \\""magic realism\\"".  Here in this story, the use of magic realism is subtle and suggested rather than demonstrated.  For example, the mother of the man who was killed had the ability to interpret dreams, but could not interpret the dream of her son the morning of his death.  The arrival of the bishop presents an ambience of distraction,unfortunate to the mayor and the priest, but fatal to for Santiago Nasar.  Also, there is a series of coincidences and discrepancies in the actions of the people of the town before the killing.  These coincidences and discrepancies form a mist through which the reader must view the events. Perhaps the most evident use of magic realism only occurs when the smell of rotting flesh clung to all those who touched the body of Santiago Nasar and also permeated the whole town for an entire day.      Reading GGM is not easy, especially in Spanish.  His style is so complex and esoteric that the reader can pass over many subtle details.  GGM uses strange words and phrases that often obscure rather than clarify what is happening.  The best student of Spanish literature will find himself challenged.  The novice may find himself overwhelmed.  Fortunately, this translation makes the task much easier English speaking person.","2008-12-18","2008","Books"

The authors attribute all this to a deliberate Jesuit conspiracy, but if the evidence they present is correct, the more likely culprit is Lucia herself.

I would have preferred the image given and the image drawn to be different from each other so kids had more freedom to be creative.  I also did not like how so many of the rhymes depended on names instead of objects that all people would be familiar with.

I recommend that everyone alive should read it.  But if you have the wrong idea about what the book is trying to accomplish, you will probably get upset about it and write an indignant review on Amazon.<br /><br />The main point of this review is to address certain objections to it put forth by many of its critics.  The objections to which I refer chiefly consist of saying that this book does not \\""prove\\"" anything and specifically, that it assumes intelligent design without \\""proving\\"" it.<br /><br />THAT IS EXACTLY THE POINT.  The point of this book is NOT TO \\""PROVE\\"" ANYTHING beyond a shadow of a doubt as some people claim or expect. The authors only purport to show that given the data of experience, Christianity is MORE LIKELY TO BE TRUE than alternative explanations such as materialism.<br /><br />The authors hold that nothing empirical can be proven beyond all doubt (as I think is the hallmark of any reasonable person), but that the truth of explanations are made more or less likely by the amount and quality of evidence for a given position.  They continue on to say that we should believe the explanation that is MOST LIKELY given the data.  Demanding \\""absolute\\"" proof for everything you believe would prevent a person who is logically consistent from doing ANYTHING.<br /><br />Also, believing in the most likely explanation for a phenomenon rather than requiring \\""absolute\\"" proof IS PERFECTLY CONSISTENT with the methodology of empirical science, as it is always seeking to perfect its understanding of the world by seeking new data and better explanations for the phenomena with which it is concerned. If things in science were taken to be proven beyond an absolute doubt, then science would cease to exist because no new explanations could be allowed or sought after.<br /><br /> A good example of this is the great delay in medical advancement by unquestioning, dogmatic adherence to the Aristotelian biological theory of the four humors.  People were not allowed to question these premises for centuries, and thus medical progress in the West was stifled until the Renaissance.<br /><br />Using presuppositional logic as the authors do is perfectly fine, because the authors' goal is to show that Christianity fits the facts of existence better than alternatives, not to prove it or any of its components beyond any possible doubt.  Presuppositional logic is especially useful in this instance, because if flaws can be found in a system's presuppositions, then the system has no chance of being true.  However, if a system's presuppositions do not of themselves lead to any contradictions or absurdities, then it must accepted as possible and in need of further investigation.<br /><br />In sum, requiring that the authors demonstrate their claims beyond any doubt is not only intellectually dishonest, it is impossible.  They are merely showing that GIVEN THE DATA OF EXISTENCE, Christianity is the best explanation for everything.ristotelian biological theory of the four humors.

Unlike those who wrote the blurbs on the book's cover, I would argue that the story within does not do justice to its setting. Readers who are looking for an inside look at the nuances of an exotic culture interspersed with a first rate mystery thriller would be best served with the likes of John Burdett's far superior Bangkok 8. The crime scenes and procedures are supposed to be brutal but even those descriptions cover tired ground - the head and the hands removed? Check. Placed on a table to be found later? Check. Corrupt cops? Check. Trying to trace a phone call before the mysterious caller disconnects? Triple check. Characterization also is lacking. Nergui's past is never explored but only hinted at, and he does nothing to separate himself from other more vibrant mystery characters from other novels. McLeish, the inspector from the UK, offers no theories that I can think of and seemingly exists just so he can be taken hostage later (this plot point is revealed on the book jacket FYI-no spoiler).  At one point, Nergui ruminates that he had come to know McLeish as not only a fellow officer, \\"" but also a friend.\\"" I don't know how they became friends because neither character offered any information to the other that would foster such a relationship.  Plot locomotion is created by a series of scenes that take place at dinners, in offices, and in bars, none of which take advantage of the Mongolian environment or are described in much detail. Upon further review, the dialogue, while serviceable and not cumbersome, consists mostly of the two detectives agreeing with each other that this case, indeed, is difficult to solve. Thumbs down, also, to the clumsy finale, in which a main baddie supplies a several-page exposition speech without much prompting, before leading to a conclusion that we have seen thousands of times before. This review reads like a slam, but the novel isn't an amateurish groaner - it just doesn't really break any new ground. I would hope that if Nergui turns up again we will see what makes the guy tick, and get away from some of the clichés that make this novel very, very average.","2008-12-18","2008","Books"

While up to 70% of our waking hours can involve work, church life and the secular workplace are typically separate worlds for many people. Mr. Andersen examines such issues as biblical attitudes and principles toward work and everyday workplace issues; using one's God-given gifts and talents; perceived Christian strengths and weaknessses as they relate to succeeding as a corporate executive; integrity and ethics; motivating the team, capitalism and profitablity, layoffs, and wealth; servanthood and giving; and executive dangers and blessings.  The book includes scriptural references, interesting quotes, and insider anecdotes from Mr. Andersen's various executive positions.      But this wonderful book is not just for Christian executives!  I have worked for nearly 40 years, not in management but as a professional engineer in the secular workplace, and after reading the entire book, I found it to be very helpful and educational in my striving to be both a good Christian and competent professional.  In fact, the book is appropriate for anyone in the secular workplace.  The book would be perfect for a Christian discussion group, and a study guide is provided for that purpose.  I heartily recommend this book.","2008-12-18","2008","Books"

Nietzsche used the genealogical approach gracefully in Beyond Good and Evil, and though I'm not completely convinced his ideas are correct; the gracefulness of his argument, and his personal experience with the chaotic political and moral nature of the European society he reacted to, form a compelling argument for his genealogical theory.<br />Foucault mocked Nietzsche's approach but prematurely formulated his \\""repressive hypothesis\\"" of thinking by which concepts result from the inexorable avalanche of history, and that sexuality has been repressed throughout our political history, therefore the only way to political liberation is sexual liberation.<br /><br />A side note: Foucault's \\""The History of Sexuality\\"" is one of the basic justifications for the queer theory that proclaims the intersection between politics, sexuality, and gender. The whole normals vs. abnormal arguments are pointless and vague, as no one can tell what is normal or abnormal in the world. The arguments presented make no sense to me, are too relativist and do not rely on any scientific reason.  It is a world devoid of absolutes where we must assume that anything and everything is permissible. This queer thinking recalls my college years, when I was irritated by new societies such as \\""The Society of Women Engineers\\"" and the \\""The Society of Black Engineers\\"". Next we will have\\"" The Society of Queer Engineers\\"" and \\""The Society of Tall Engineers'.  What happened to treating humans as humans, who share life regardless of their gender, color or physical appearance? How can we ask for equality between genders when we defeat the whole purpose by being feminists or some other separate group?<br /><br />Back to \\""The History of Sexuality\\"", Foucault reviews history to find out why our sexuality became the key to unlocking the truth about us, and arrives at the relationship sex has with power and knowledge. Foucault traces the emergence of sexuality to the seventeenth century, when the Christian emphasis on sins of the flesh led to an increasing awareness of sexuality in family relations. His road to the genesis of human sexuality ends with the bourgeois of the nineteenth century, who effectively invented what we think of as \\""sexuality,\\"" and used it as a way of protecting and separating themselves from the other groups. Foucault acknowledges that sex is not our essence, but rather it is a social construct that makes it easier to control humans. Here Foucault didn't provide any definite prove to his theory. It even sounds more convincing that the opposite is the truth: Sex and all its biological drives are an essential part of our nature and, therefore,  it makes us more susceptible to control.<br /><br />The point Foucault tried to make in many lengthy ways is that how we understand certain concepts has a lot to do with what other concepts we link them to, and in this thought construct, sexuality is not a concept as much as means of linking concepts to each other. Foucault strong, initial argument that our sexual desires or behaviors themselves do not express profound truths about us, rather it is the discourse we have built up around those desires and behaviors that suggest the profound truth. These discourses are not fixed and changeable with time and needs.  The growing importance of sexuality in our society reflects the fact that we have found more and more concepts that we can connect through sexuality, and in this way the \\""deployment of sexuality\\"" is the way that we use sexuality to join different concepts. The history of sexuality is a history of class dominance, where sexuality is a social construct that can be used to link power and knowledge to sex in a variety of different ways.<br /><br />  Finally, Foucault arrives at the conclusion that human life (and its aspects including sexuality)throughout history came to fall under the control of politics, where \\""bio power\\"" or the new power over life controls life through the discipline of the body and through the regulation of population. It's beyond me how Foucault arrived at this conclusion while discussing how wars got fiercer than ever, how the death penalty became a safeguard not an act of destruction, and how power seems now to control life and population.<br />I suspect that Foucault, through his arguments, wanted to weaken the concept of sexuality.  By simply calling it a social construction, he will weaken the political powers themselves. I also suspect by the way that Foucault identified the four centers that have power and knowledge related  to sex(hysterization of women's bodies, pedagogization of children's sex, socialization of procreative behavior, and psychiatrization of perverse pleasure) that he was trying to differentiate by what is socially considered a  normal behavior and what is not. This is again a losing argument since it's purely a personal way of looking at things.<br /><br />As a big fan of Nietzsche (his method of debate not his actual ideas), I don't think that Foucault even came close to Nietzsche's genealogical approach. Foucault took a very exciting topic and managed to destroy his argument with a lengthy complicated delivery, the biggest problem with some philosophers is that they are trying so hard to be original that they overlook the obvious or they wrap it up in such a complex knot you can't possibly untie it. .ll under the control of politics, where \\""bio power\\"" or the new power over life controls life through the discipline of the body and through the regulation of population.

Mostly it is about her and not largely about her tour or work, although it is part of her story. True Love discusses her journey into discovering what love means to her. She speaks candidly about herself and her marriage to Marc Anthony and the heartache of divorce. I think it is useful for any woman of similar age maybe going through same thing. It is an empowering, self-focused biopic that True Love comes from loving yourself and allowing someone else to love you fully. Personally I am grateful to her for writing it. She discusses more of her insights about what she learned coming out of this at the end of the book, maybe Amazon customer only read beginning part which is about her tour and decided to give up, but that is where a lot of information is. I thought it was a good, easy read and engaging. She bares herself about her fears and mistakes, and it was like she was talking to me as a friend.","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

You will not find detailed discussions of calendars, apps and the technical details of time management. Instead, you will learn powerful concepts and strategies to get more done.  A few of my favorite insights from the book: -Always Be Prepared. The author shares a great example of making the most of unexpected time. He arrives at a meeting and the other party is delayed. As a result of planning ahead, he is able to write up notes for another project and write a thank you note. That is much more productive than what many of us might do (e.g. check email over and over again on the phone).  -Improved Networking. Our relationships made a big difference in our productivity. The author suggests several great questions to deepen our understanding of someone we just met. Here are two examples: What's a great book you have read lately? and &#34;What is interesting to you these days?&#34;  -Feedback. What a great discussion! You will learn about multiple types of feedback (including informal feedback comments) and how to use this information to improve. A great question to ask about feedback: &#34;Did you see it coming or was it a surprise&#34;  A great book to help you get better and achieve your results faster.","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

Or at least I thought it did until I considered it further. Having been delighted with the sheer poetic elegance of \\""Tinker Tailor,\\"" \\""Smiley's People,\\"" \\""The Perfect Spy\\"" and \\""The Russia House,\\"" I felt somewhat uncomfortable with \\""The Tailor of Panama\\"" and \\""The Constant Gardener.\\"" There seemed to me a discordant note in these later works. \\""The Tailor of Panama,\\"" though written with Le Carre's usual verve, was almost a farce, while \\""The Constant Gardener\\"" was deeply disturbing. This latest offering, too, is disturbing and, at times, seems almost farcical.<br /><br /> And that is where the real power of this novel lies. What it does is take all the subtle \\""British\\"" elements that made Le Carre such a joy to read in previous novels and juxtaposes them with the \\""Die Hard\\"" mentality that characterises most modern \\""thrillers\\"" and, one suspects, the western intelligence community under the influence of Bush's America. Le Carre is not only lamenting the gradual extinction of the fine story telling of which he is the absolute master, but also, perhaps, the sublety that once characterised western intelligence operations. It is truely a lament for a lost world - a place that once had room for stories that were both poetic and inspiring, a place that once had room for Smiley but now only has room for John McCain.<br /><br />This is not just a clever book - it is sublime.","2008-12-19","2008","Books"

I became interested in this series because I grew up watching Disney movies, listening and reading these fable stories, and did role-playing with the characters as a child. Also because these fables are a part of American childhood culture and I was enthusiastic that the author created a series for adult taste that I can enjoy during this age of my life. I also appreciate art as well. Some fable characters that are in this book are Snow White, Cinderella, the Beauty and the Beast, Jack from the beanstalk fairy tale, the wolf and the three little pigs, and more.<br /><br />All of the fable characters live in a town called Fabletown in New York. It is reclusive to only its fable members. They have been in exile due to a powerful god or woodland sprite called the adversary. The wolf is the detective and he has to find out what happen to Rose Red which is Snow White’s sister. He suspects that she is the victim of violence or possibly homicide or suicide. Snow White works for the government as director of operations. She assists the wolf during most of the investigation.<br /><br />It is very suspenseful and the writing style and illustrations help keep the reader interested. This comic book shows that in reality fairy tales may not happen or as often as we want them to but if we stay diligent and work hard we may be able to reap some rewards in life. I expect for more stories to unfold in the following volumes. You have to read it for yourself and the ending will literally blow your mind. I also like how the illustrator draws flashbacks during some scenes when a person is talking. The story is presented like a movie which is what I love the most. There are also lots of surprises in this book that will have you thinking, “ I didn’t expect that to happen”.  I also like that there is a lot of text in this book. It takes me longer to read this book than it does with another type of comic bookthat is the same amount of pages.<br /><br />The only thing that could have been better is if the characters had been more interesting, unique and developed. But it’s still a 5-star graphic novel to me due to the suspense, humor, plot, writing style, illustrations, and being a feel good comic book!","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

Maybe when you get to the 720th page you'll feel that there are some scenes that could have been eliminated, some scenes that could have gone more smoothly, and some descriptive passages that could have been shortened.<br /><br />But here's what you'll find: Scott Lynch has tried for the picaresque fantasy, and has created for his setting the city of Comorra, which is meant to resemble Venice, although clearly the book is not set on planet earth. This world has multiple moons, ruins of a previous civilization, and sorcery is practiced.<br /><br />It has literary pretensions (it's published by Bantam Spectra, which specializes in that sort of thing), and while it is certainly well-written, Lynch (fortunately) lacks the \\""look at me! I'm writing!\\"" pretentiousness of some of his contemporaries in this field. His grifter-hero, Locke Lamora, is a fascinating rogue, and the plot takes delightful twists and turns. It's not always a fun read, though: some of the scenes, for example when Locke tricks a money-lender out of his fashionable outfit, are amusing, but there are scenes of graphic violence, too.<br /><br />Mr. Lynch has come up with an interesting, but occasionally frustrating, way to tell the tale. He provides \\""interludes,\\"" which flash back to Locke's days as an apprentice to a supposedly blind priest, and he means them to throw some light, and some hints, on the action that is taking place in the book's \\""present.\\"" While they do provide information as to why Locke and his fellow \\""gentlemen bastards\\"" behave as they do, they tend to appear while Locke is hanging from a literary cliff--and some of them don't supply enough information to make the diversion worthwhile, and a few of them seem tossed in simply because, well . . .<br /><br />Notes and asides: First of at least three, but complete in itself.

The mysterious, creepy place surrounded completely by water, where the worst of the worst criminals were sent.  Have you ever wondered what it would be like to have a prison guard as a dad?  Well then the Newbery Honor Award book, \\""Al Capone Does My Shirts\\"" is right for you.  Matthew Flanagan (Moose) and his family have just moved to Alcatraz and Moose and have to do his best to fit in.  I think this is a great and exciting book to read.     I would recommend this book to older elementary students and young teens who like a little bit of history mixed in with adventures, murderers, mob bosses, and convicts.  I recommend this book to older elementary students and young teens because older teens and adults would be bored with the easy reading, although younger kids might get a little confused throughout the book.  The author does a good job of keeping the same audience throughout the book, and I think the genre of this book is historical fiction because it takes place in 1935 when the worst criminals lived on Alcatraz like Al Capone, and Machine Gun Kelly, and I know that this book is fiction because some of the events that go on in the story didn't really happen.  This book is somewhat similar to another historical fiction book that I have read because both of the books are about a boy who moves to somewhere else with his family, and doesn't fit in.     The book \\""Al Capone Does My Shirts\\"" by Gennifer Choldenko, takes place on Alcatraz Island in 1935.  The Flanagan family had just moved to Alcatraz for Mr. Flanagan's job as a prison guard.  Matthew (Moose) and his sister Natalie have to try to fit in with everyone else.  Moose goes to a public school is San Francisco, but Natalie on the other has some mental problems.  Natalie is just not like every other kid on the island.  She is really fifteen but her mom every year has her turn ten again, again, and again.  It has been five years Nataliehas turn ten over, and over, again.  Mrs. Flanagan just doesn't like to think of Natalie older than Moose who is twelve.  Natalie is sent to a special boarding school called Esther P. Marinoff in San Francisco to help her with her special needs.  Although, the first day she was having really bad tantrums so they told the Flanagan's that she wasn't ready for their program.  After Natalie gets booted out, Mrs. Flanagan has her meet with a special teacher to help her with her need so she can try to get in to Esther P. Marinoff again.  Although on the other hand Moose is having a good time at his school and his friends who live on Alcatraz all decide that they should tell everyone at their school about how the convicts wash their clothes, and then have everyone pay them to have the convicts wash their clothes.  Moose and his friends get in lots of trouble when the warden found out that they did this.  The warden says that he might kick the Flanagan's off the island because of this.  After improving with Mrs. Kelly, Natalie's special tutor, Natalie goes back for another interview at Esther P. Marinoff and doesn't make it this time either.  Moose tries to help out his sister by writing a letter to Al Capone to help Natalie somehow to get into Esther P. Marinoff.  Will the Flanagan's get kicked off of Alcatraz?  Will Capone actually help out?  You have to read the book to find out!     You might like this book if you have seen the Mythbusters episode on the Discovery Channel to see if it was possible to actually escape from Alcatraz.  This is somewhat similar to \\""Al Capone Does My Shirts\\"" because it takes place in the same time when all the convicts still lived on Alcatraz.     I think there are many strengths of this book, but there also are some weaknesses to it.  One strength of the book is that there is an actual picture of Alcatraz Island in the book and it is labeled where everything is and where everyone lives. This helps the reader visualize where everything is onthe island.  Another strength is that the book has lots of suspense, so it keeps the reader interested and want to keep reading.  For example one chapter ends when Moose leaves Natalie alone, and when he comes back she's gone.  One last strength of the book is that the author always stays on the topic.  For example, you she never completely changes what's going on.  Although, there are some weaknesses of the book, including that the author doesn't use very good descriptions of the characters.  This makes it harder to visualize what they actually look like.     Altogether, I think \\""Al Capone Does My Shirts\\"" is a great book.  It is adventurous and there is even history tied into it.  I would recommend this book to all young teens and older elementary students because it kind of teaches you a lesson that everyone should know.","2008-12-19","2008","Books"

I list these characters because they were so realistic and so fascinating that I want a sequel!  I want to know more - what happens with Daria and Cameron?  Does Marco find a teacher who appreciates him? Will Ann finally get her comeuppance?  These questions are not to suggest that the book is lacking anything, only to say that it is so realistically told and contains such interesting characters.    As a high school teacher, I was quite annoyed by Mrs. Gold, the teacher who thought this bullying trial would be educational.

His brief pugilistic memoirs absorb the reader into a world where seedy contracts and menacing intentions are held at bay by the humanity gleaming in each fighters eyes. His star struck meeting with Sugar Ray Leonard, his odd encounters with the ambiguous Mike Tyson and his awkward descriptions of the charisma of Nigel Benn are all to be held with the highest regard.<br /><br />Only two years after reading Dark Trade I strived to reach that same depth when I wrote my first boxing novel 'Virgin Gloves'.

In Autophobia, Ladd doesn't disappoint.  This original and slightly contrarian account of our century-long love-hate relationship with the automobile covers a tremendous amount of historical ground in an economical, entertaining read.  Anchored by anecdotes ranging from the hilarious to the heartbreaking (including a priceless account of road-hog Toad and his fancy auto machine), Ladd offers insight into the current turn against the auto and into how modern life has become increasingly dependent and designed around cars, whether we drive them or not.  An excellent book for our difficult times.","2008-12-19","2008","Books"

In Debt.","3","3","4","N","Y","Hope is not a strategy","The authors \\""reverse engineered\\"" this book from the documentary film I.O.U.S.A. that debuted (first cut) at the Sundance Film festival in early 2008 and opened (final form) at theaters around the country on August 21.<br /><br />The film was in turn conceived of as a way to publicize the message of an earlier book, \\""Empire of Debt: The Rise of an Epic Financial Crisis,\\"" William Bonner and Addison Wiggin, John Wiley & Sons (2006).  See my review, which was lukewarm because the authors offered no solutions for the problems they diagnosed.  (I prefer solutions to gloom and doom.)<br /><br />Along the way, U.S. Comptroller General David Walker (now president and CEO of the Peterson Foundation) and Robert Bixby, President of the Concord Coalition became involved in the film and Walker wrote a foreword for the companion book.<br /><br /> Walker and Bixby were the prime movers of the Fiscal Wakeup Tour (2005-2008), by the way, which conducted town hall meetings in more than 30 states (primarily on university campuses).  The film shows them in action as part of the effort to put a human face on issues of \\""dry\\"" economic policy.  Also, Walker's thinking about four U.S. deficits (budget, savings, trade, and leadership) became the structural framework for the film.<br /><br />Given this complex background (book - tour - film - book 2), it is hardly surprising that the I.O.U.S.A. book lacks cohesiveness.  So far as the \\""we are in a crisis that must be dealt with very soon\\"" message is concerned, I would recommend the film instead.  It is still showing in theaters, and will hopefully come out on DVD one of these days.<br /><br />That being said, the personal views and motivations of many of the financial and government people who appeared in the film are neatly captured, both in the text (a brief 94 pages) and in appended interviews (166 pages) that put the comments in context and are easier to follow.  The witnesses (if that's the right word) are Alice Rivlin, William Bonner, Robert Rubin, Peter G. Peterson, Ron Paul, Paul Volcker, Alan Greenspan, Warren Buffet, James Areddy, Paul O'Neill, Arthur Laffler, and Steve Forbes, and their views are well worth pondering.<br /><br />As might be expected, I.O.U.S.A. draws a parallel between the economic ills that the authors and others have been predicting for some time and the subprime crisis and oil price spike leading us into recession situation that began in 2007 and is still in progress.  \\""With any luck, we'll make fiscal responsibility hip in Washington again and inject the themes of the book and the film into the national conversation well before and long after the 2008 election.\\""<br /><br />Unfortunately, things appear to be headed in a different direction right now, with dramatically eased money policy and a trillion dollar deficit in store for fiscal year 2009.

I have never been disappointed with a Klutz book/kit.<br /><br />This book is a bit different than the typical craft books published by Klutz. It was developed in conjunction with the Metropolitan Museum of Art and has a lot of educational, world history and art history information in the book.<br /><br />The book starts back in Ancient History with Ancient Egypt. The book teaches about art and writing (hieroglyphics) done by the Ancient Egyptians. Then the kit encourages the child-reader to make their own art, Egyptian style. The book progresses through various art methods and across thousands of years, introducing educational information then telling how to replicate that art or craft.<br /><br />Another way this Klutz publication is different is that it has some pretty sophisticated art methods. There is a copper page to make a copper cover with metal embossing decoration using texture plates that is then made into a little handmade book. The book covers collage and includes some interesting images to cut out and collage with. The book tackles basic drawing principles and sketching in pencil, watercolor painting, and how to use one paintbrush to make different painted effects. Sun prints are here too, a more crafty leaning project. Boys especially might like the section on medieval history and knights with an activity to design their own coat of armor. Illumination is here with powdered paint that is to be mixed with egg whites to paint with. There is also a section for making a replica of stained glass (coloring in a paper) and a paper weaving project.<br /><br />The book has MANY examples of real art going back thousands of years. The reference in the back of the book explains what each image is with a historical reference.<br /><br />This is an ambitious book that teaches art and crafts linked to real world history events and showing examples of fine artworks. The book is inspirational. There are enough projects here to keep a child and a preteen occupied for many hours. It would be of interest to boys as well as girls. I can imagine that if a child does one of these projects for the first time they may be inspired to continue on learning more about some of the techniques(drawing, sketching, and watercolor painting).<br /><br />The book is a low cost for the smattering of craft and art materials that come with it and for all the educational content that goes along with the instructions on how to do each art or craft.<br /><br />If your child already owns many art and craft supplies, especially if they own some professional grade materials, makes a lot of art at home or is already taking professional art instruction, and if they already had lots of history educational instruction, this book may be too shallow or repetitive for them. However if the child has not yet tried all these arts and crafts or been exposed to all this world history information, the book is fantastic.<br /><br />This makes a wonderful gift!

I spent the first 18 years of my life in Gail and went through all 12 grades of school there, graduating in 1962.  At the time I lived there, the school had a higher population than the town of Gail. It is (and I emphasize the word IS) a county school that brings in students from all over the county rather than just from the town of Gail.  I was rather surprised to read in this book that \\""There used to be a town in Texas called Gail\\"", and that \\""-the town is no more\\"", and \\""-the old Gail School remains an abandoned shambles.\\""  According to the book, this was due to a girl committing suicide in the girls bathroom, followed shortly by the principal killing himself in his office.    I was surprised to read of Gail no longer existing, especially because only two days prior to receiving the book I had driven through Gail and saw the multi million dollar school still standing with green trees and a manicured football field, and strange beings that looked somewhat like people walking around.  Could I have possibly seen a portal to the past?  With the ghosts of what? Perhaps last year running around?  Or did Gail meet its demise a few days after I passed through?     Now I will admit the town of Gail is nothing to grab anyone's attention, with a number of closed, shuttered buildings, (it was the same when I lived there) but there are within 10 or 20 the same number of people living in Gail as there was in 1962 when I left.  Granted, not the same people, but the same number.    The school is now much bigger than when I attended.  Originally, there was one 3 story brick building.  By the time I was in 4th grade a cafeteria and large number of classrooms had been added. They also built a modern gym, and auditorium.    I came back in 1982 for my 20 year reunion to find even greater improvements, including computers in  every classroom.  Today the school continues to thrive with the help of the oil taxes from the county.  The old brick building that students went to school in during the 30s still stands. It has been in use and improved continuously and was never left to ruins.   Right now there are 155 students in the school, the court house still stands improved from my time and still supports the necessary; judge, sheriff, county clerk, etc that most court houses have.    As far as the nameless girl that hanged herself and the unknown principal who shot himself. There has never been a suicide, or death of any kind on or related to the school. The school has never been shut down, the town has never disappeared, and if anyone tries to \\""negotiate the debris in the darkness\\"" finding your way to the principal's office, or search for the old bathroom to find the hanging student, I'm sure you will get your excitement as you are arrested within minutes after setting off the alarm system.     I enjoy reading mysteries, and weird happenings, but it would be nice if the stories are based on at least some sort of fact, and that what is put out as fact was actually checked out.  The authors claim to research the stories, somehow they missed this one.  They wouldn't even have to visit Gail, just a simple internet search turns up all sorts of information about present day Gail and the School.    After reading the completely fictional account of Gail Texas, I found myself losing interest in many of the other stories in the book. Now I don't know if they are based on `real rumors' or just made up on the spot.   It's hard to get excited about \\""true\\"" stories when I can get just as much entertainment from Stephen King.    I'll give this book a two thumbs down for lack of accuracy.","2008-12-19","2008","Books"

She had thought for days about how much she cared about him, and had imagined spending dusky evenings eating beans with him while the sun was in the sky. He was a good man. As good as any man she ever knew.     Suddenly, there was a sound in the air. Something happened. Ronald ducked down. Nooly saw him duck. She thought to herself about all of the danger she had ever seen. She realized that a dangerous thing might be above her. She ducked down low, lower even than Ronald. Nearby, a Dirt Person was trying pitifully to scratch out a living in the dirt with primitive, quaint tools. The dangerous thing was on top of the dirt person. The thing cut off the dirt person's hand. Blood was everywhere. The hand was lying in a crimson pool of red blood.     Ronald opened the book. He was the strongest, best person in a five-mile radius.

Unfortunately, I cannot. The book is poorly edited and poorly proofread. There is a distressing number of glaring errors of spelling, grammar, and punctuation.  Also, Suskind's writing style is leaden and preachy at times. He gives long, detailed descriptions of conversations in which people aren't talking about much of anything. The book is structured in a way that makes you feel like you are reading five or six long magazine articles simultaneously. First, you have a page about the exchange student from Afghanistan. Then, a page about the innocent man who was arrested just because police thought he looked suspicious. Then a page about the innocent man being detained at Guantanamo, and his lawyer. Then, a page about the anti-terrorism expert. Then, another page about the exchange student. Then, another page about the Pakistani who was walking near the White House wearing a backpack. Another page about the suffering man in Guantanamo. Suskind keeps jumping around like this, giving a fragment of one story, then a fragment of another, then another. Reading a book that is written this way can get tedious after a while. I think it would have been better if Suskind had simply told each story from start to finish without interruption, and given each story a separate chapter.<br /><br />Even more serious is the question of whether Suskind has been careful to check his facts. For example, on page 119, he says that Donald Rumsfeld resigned as Defense Secretary in mid-December of 2006. Rumsfeld resigned on November 8th. It makes you wonder. If Suskind couldn't get it right when talking about such a well-known and easily checkable fact, how can we be sure he got his other facts right?<br /><br />So now I've told you the things that I didn't like about this book. These are the reasons why I couldn't give it a five-star review. Happily, the book's good qualities outweigh its bad ones. First, the book does contain some very good writing. Suskind has a talent for parallels. The best example of this occurs early in the book,  when President George W. Bush is making a speech about the great American values of freedom, democracy, and respect for human rights at the very same moment that a law-abiding, America-loving Pakistani man is having his rights violated by Washington DC police.  Suskind alternates between the two scenes, the president's rhetoric, trying to sound like Lincoln or Churchill, and the police's actions, suggestive of a dictatorship, less than a mile away at the same time. This is probably the best example of pure good writing in the book.<br /><br />There are other good qualities as well. This book has probably the best explanation we will ever get about the 16 word scandal. (The president's January 28th, 2003 State of the Union address included these words: \\""The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.\\"" In fact, the British government had never learned any such thing. In February, Colin Powell gave his presentation to the United Nations. In March, the war was launched. In May, the president gave his \\""Mission Accomplished\\"" speech. In July, the White House admitted that those 16 words should not have been included in the president's speech.)<br /><br />Of course, the book's biggest bombshell, and the main reason why people will want to read it and recommend it, is the revelation that CIA director George Tenet quietly carried out a White House order to plant a false story in the media for the purpose of influencing public opinion. If Suskind is correct about this, then important laws were broken, and serious crimes were committed. Tenet should have notified the Senate Intelligence Committee that the White House was ordering him to commit a crime. Instead, he just did what he was told. Those of you who don't have time to read the whole book, and just want to go straight to \\""the good part,\\"" will find it on pages 361-380. I very strongly hope that Barack Obama will find time to read those 20 pages, at least (if not the whole book) before he takes office on January 20th.<br /><br />In closing, I would like to point out that Suskind's favorite theme, woven throughout most of his writing, is of the conflict between \\""partisanship\\"" on the one hand, and \\""honest brokering\\"" on the other. In writing this review, I have made a sincere effort to be an honest broker.od part,\\"" will find it on pages 361-380.

Very popular throughout Russian history, these rich and diverse tales were typically passed from generation to generation orally due to the fact that the vast majority of Russians were illiterate.  However, these stories were not just for the Russian serfs and poor.  Rich and poor alike enjoyed these stories, including the Czars.  For example, Czar Ivan IV (the Terrible) was said to have \\""three old blind men [following] each other at his bedside, relating fairy tales before he slumbered\\"".  The book Russian Fairy Tales, collected by Aleksandr Afanas'ev and translated by Norbert Guterman, gathers and translates many of these fairy tale stories into one source.<br /><br />The book itself consists of a large amount of stories (179 total) followed at the end of the book by a folkloristic commentary.  There is no apparent ordering to the stories; they seem randomly dispersed.  The vast majority of the stories are very short, averaging only a few pages each.  In fact, many of the stories are less than a page long.  I would have preferred less and longer stories, which are more complicated and detailed.  Fortunately, there were a few such stories in the book, which I found to be the most enjoyable ones.  The book is handsomely illustrated throughout by Alexander Alexeieff in a style resembling wood carvings, matching the feel and style of the stories perfectly.  The commentary at the end of the book, written by Russian linguist Roman Jokobson, goes into depth about the history of folklore in Russia and how these stories were passed on.  It is well written and very informative and enjoyable, offering an insight into the process and cultural basis of these stories.<br /><br />The stories themselves are very diverse yet simple.  There are a few common themes throughout, including regular appearances by Baba Yaga (a witch-like character), anthropomorphic animals, and peasant empowerment.  Many of the stories also have dark themes, characters, and events that would seem inappropriate in today's children stories.  For example, there are many instances of death and limbs or heads being hacked off.  Like most fairy tales, most of the stories end with a positive lesson or moral; the overly greedy get punished and the heroic and respectful get rewarded.  However, there are a few odd stories that seem to have no moral and end abruptly, such as one below:<br />The bear entered the room.  From fear the old man groaned [...] and the old woman coughed [...].  The bear found them and ate them.<br />Maybe this is just a facet of Russian humor, but it seems quirky and out of place.  However, the stories are for the most part entertaining, albeit a bit repetitive after the first hundred or so.<br /><br />Altogether, Russian Fairy Tales delivers exactly what its title describes.  Unfortunately, the author decided to go with quantity over quality.  There are just too many extremely short stories and not enough long stories.  That does not mean the works are not enjoyable, the reader just has to sift through a lot of less enjoyable or odd stories to get to the gems.  However, the book does offer a good insight into the Russian folklore tradition, and the commentary at the end of the book was excellent.  Also, the pictures throughout the book got me into the mood of the material, which added to the overall experience.  I would recommend reading the book if you have any interest in Russian fairy tales.d peasant empowerment.

My issue is with the messenger. Jenny is a clever woman who easily wins people over with her warm demeanor and self-deprecating wit. However, I cannot take what she says at face value. Her book is supposed to be about open \\""marriage\\"", but it has been (rather sheepishly) dedicated to her girlfriend. This subtle but cavalier gesture underscores the self-centered attitude that drives the story within.    We learn of Jenny's amazing power to attract youthful lesbian lovers who previously identified as straight (\\""whee\\""). We learn how she cheated on her spouse for the simple reason that she really, really likes having sex with other people (who doesn't?). And we learn how her husband is \\""the rock\\"" in a marriage where he seemingly only exists to help her reach \\""the sky\\""... her girlfriend. How nice. I'm sure every spouse, male or female, aspires for such a role.    I agree with Jenny that our culture is overdue for a reexamination of monogamy. This simply isn't the book to accomplish it. Jenny is bisexual and has an arrangement that allows for male and female lovers if she so decides. However, other bisexuals practice a form of \\""gender monogamy\\"" in which only partners of the same gender are allowed. Still others consider themselves sexually monogamous but engage in extramarital emotional relationships. Essentially, we can live as we please as long as it is for the betterment of everyone involved. Which is why it would be nice to hear the argument from her husband's perspective instead of exclusively from a person who is so gung-ho about wanting it all, at any cost.    If mainstream America is ever going to buy into this lifestyle, we need more than lip service and a ring on the cover. We need the whole story. As it stands, \\""Open\\"" would make a better episode of \\""Desperate Housewives\\"" than an instructional course in Polyamory 101. It may be a lurid and honest story, but it fails to persuade.    What value is honesty in the absence of honor? Not much, I'm afraid.","2008-12-19","2008","Books"

For each category, Cerveny provides short tidbits of strange occurrences, further classified and organized, that were previously reported in scientific (and some not so scientific) journals, magazines and papers throughout history.<br /><br />However, if you picked up this book expecting a meteorological version of works by Sam Kean (author of &#34;The Disappearing Spoon&#34; and &#34;The Violonists Thumb&#34;) or Bill Bryson (&#34;A Short History of Nearly Everything&#34;), you will be disappointed.<br /><br />Cerveny does make the information approachable and easy to understand, but expresses facts and stories as if in a college lecture expecting his readers to be undergrads desperately scrambling to take notes for a final exam. That is to say that information is given quickly and succinctly. This book entirely misses any human aspect of extreme weather and instead offers a quick sound off of various examples of weather oddities. In actuality, it is more like a transcript of lecture notes or an academic research paper than an interwoven and engaging story. This is fine if all you want from the book is quick facts. However, if you want in depth explanations, discussions or interesting anecdotes woven together in a seamless story, then this book is not for you.<br /><br />A final note: I echo many other reveiwers in saying that this book is in serious need of editing.","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

While the format is slightly different than her average anthology (the stories are longer, so there are only seven stories), it is the perfect book to cuddle in bed with (either alone or with a partner), preferably with a streaming cup of tea, cocoa or apple cider, and maybe even a loving cat.<br /><br />As a queer woman, I can tell when hetero erotica is truly well written (in my opinion), because it turns me on, even if it wouldn't turn me on in the real world. My verdict? Most of these stories are absolutely brilliant. While many have long lead ins, and not as much sex as I'd like, the sexual parts are wonderfully written, creating beautiful visuals.<br /><br />My favorite stories would have to be:<br />Hidden Treasure by Sophie Mouette, although that might be my history buff speaking. Fun, flirty, and really enjoyable to read.<br /><br />Six Weeks on Sunrise Mountain, Colorado by Gwen Masters. Now, I'm a little biased, being from Colorado, but I really loved this one. Great imagery, and an interesting concept as well.<br /><br />One Night in Winter, by Kristina Wright. This is probably the fastest paced story, and sometimes, that is just what you are looking for.

The Ultimate Book of Explosions big and small\\"" is a relatively short book that DESCRIBES examples of explosions.  There are plenty of photos showing this and that.  The reader gets descriptions of fireworks and of well-known explosions, such as the Hindenburg Disaster.    This is a book that, at first glance, seems to be written for 13-yr old to 16-year old boys.  However, the more I think about it, the more worried I get about dangerous consequences.  Probably, the material is not suited to non-adults.    There is plenty of 'data' in this book, but it is of the type that says that lightning bolts could light a whole bunch of electric bulbs.    Personally, I found the descriptive material provided by the Amazon ad site to be slightly misleading.  This is NOT a book of technology.  Be sure to check the book out carefully before giving it to a non-adult.  I found an experiment with \\""exploding custard\\"" that could be dangerous to a child, because it does not explain that the experimenter should maintain a safe distance and use other safety precautions and does not explain how to do that. It also has an experiment on \\""making a rocket\\"" from an empty plastic soda bottle that could lead to over-pressurization of the bottle, leading to rupture of the plastic and explosion of the bottle.  When you check the book out, be certain to ask: \\""WHAT COULD GO WRONG?\\"" at every page.      If you do give this book to anyone under age 21, be sure to tell them that they must carry out any experiments under ADULT SUPERVISION!  And, the adult should know safety procedures in testing dangerous materials.  I have worked in chemistry laboratories for over 35 years.  This book bothers me.  There is too much room for Murphy's law to operate. (If anything can go wrong, it will. And, if nothing can go wrong, it, still, will go wrong.) There should be a separate \\""Warning\\"" section, saying that unsupervised experimentation is very dangerous to the experimenter.  And, there should be strong advice on safety precautions.    Though I have rated the book relatively well, I do not recommend this book for children under age 21.  Sorry about that, I have seen too many stupid accidents.","2008-12-19","2008","Books"

They take the girl back to the village where she grows up wild and mysterious amongst the Gatherers, those unworthy of living inside the walls of House Abascar. The girl, Auralia, has a unique gift, the ability to weave breathtaking colors from the world around her. When Queen Jaralaine issues a proclamation that sends all of House Abascar into a colorless season of winter, Auralia's gift becomes illegal.<br /><br />As Abascar's Winter stretches year after year Auralia grows up, nearing the age of sixteen when all enter House Abascar for the Rites of Privilege to show what gifts they might offer the kingdom. As the Rites draw near, Auralia must decide if she will go and reveal her gift to the king or if she will remain safely hidden in the forest all her days. Either way, her choice could mean the end of life as she knows it.<br /><br />Auralia's Colors was a unique book. The writing was beautiful. I couldn't read it as fast as I like to read. It had many point of views, but the author brought them all together in the end in a wonderful way that fulfilled most of the plot lines, but left several dangling so that I have to read the next book to find out what happens. It was entertaining, creative, and unique. Recommended.","2008-12-19","2008","Books"

He now has the opportunity to get answers from the woman who caused all the heartache. Danica and Jaden had a whirlwind affair that had them falling for each other hard and fast.

Around 523 B.C. the Persian King Cambyses, having conquered Egypt, sent an army of 50,000 west across the desert against the Ammonians. The army made it halfway there and then was lost, reportedly buried in a sandstorm. They were never heard from again. What would happen, Sussman's novel asks, if the remains of that army were found today, the swords and shields and supply wagons and the men themselves perfectly preserved for two and a half millennia by the desert sands?<br /><br />After dramatizing the sandstorm in his prologue, Sussman brings the story to the present, when rumor of the army's discovery has excited the interests of some unsavory characters. There are two strands to Sussman's narrative. A pair of gruesome murders somehow connected with an archaeological relic gets Inspector Yusuf Khalifa of the Luxor police involved. The case is particularly interesting to him because he is an amateur archaeologist himself, and because the relic is being sought by a notorious terrorist with whom Khalifa has a history. The story is also told from the perspective of Tara Mullray, whose trip to Egypt to visit her archaeologist father turns ugly after the murders.<br /><br />Sussman's novel feels overlong at times and it's never quite edge-of-your-seat gripping, but it has a lot going for it: likable characters--particularly Khalifa--a clever, well-plotted story, some great scenes in the last third of the book in Egypt's western desert, and a pair of wholly unexpected plot twists at the book's end.<br /><br />-- Debra Hamel","2008-12-19","2008","Books"

As a reader of National Review for a quarter century and a latter-day Reaganaut, I had high hopes.  But it turns out a more apt title would be \\""The William F. Buckley Who Knew the Reagans and Gave One Clever Advice While Flirting With the Other.\\""  I don't know whether WFB simply descended into narcissism in his last years or he simply had not the opportunity to fix this mess, but what he left us was a maddening book, full of little else than . . . WFB.<br /><br />The book strikes me as awfully lazy, a pastiche of vignettes, letters, and transcripts.  There is here no good argument, no sustained apologia nor polemic on Reagan's virtues, when we all know that WFB thought highly of him.<br /><br />It's tiresome to read one WFB letter after another, especially when there are references to the Reagan letters WFB is receiving but not revealing to us.  It seems Buckley just for this purpose saved copies of the letters he sent out, while deeming most of the Reagan letters he actually received not to be worthy of publication in a book . .  that's supposed to be about Reagan.  There are a few Reagan letters, but they are too few, and these tend to be edited down.<br /><br />For the Reagan WFB knew, a reader would more profitably acquire and read 'Ronald Reagan:  A Life in Letters,' which includes complete versions of many of RR's letters to WFB that are curtailed for this book.<br /><br />And then there's an absolutely bizarre chapter describing a purported conversation between Clare Booth Luce and Defense Secretary Weinberger about Reagan and nuclear weapons that takes place in Hawaii.  Is this a concocted drama?  Was WFB there?  It's unclear what to make of it.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book for anyone wanting to know Reagan better.  Read any of the \\""in his own hand\\"" materials that have been published in the past few years, and give this a pass.","2008-12-19","2008","Books"

It plays Blu-ray discs and has an easy to navigate menu that you can't get lost in. This is my first Blu-ray player and so far it has worked well. First off, I think this Sony player looks great. I like the angles and the triangular buttons. It looks like metal when it really is plastic. This Sony doesn't feel all that sturdy and feels like it is made of cheap plastics even when it looks premium. The disc tray is kind of noisy when moved in and out although that isn't much of a problem. The remote that comes with the player is pretty small and has nice rubber buttons feel pretty good. The menu is very easy to navigate and while I didn't use most of the apps that came with the player I still would think that anyone who was into that would be pleased. Coming from regular DVD, I didn't see much of a difference between Blu-ray and DVD but once I watched a few Blu-ray movies I could tell the difference. You might not be able to tell the difference through your built in TV speakers but if you have a sound bar or a surround sound system set up you will really be able to tell the difference. Explosions are booming but detailed, and dialogue is very clear. The picture is also affected. The picture is a bit better with Blu-ray but some people might not be able to tell the difference. If you want to see the difference, try out Blu-ray for yourself or look up Blu-ray vs DVD on Google Images. I found the price of around $70 to be pretty good for a nice Blu-ray player. Setup was easy and quick and took less than 10 minutes. Remember, if you are using the Blu-ray player, remember to use Blu-ray discs to get the full Blu-ray experience. Blu-ray might cost more than DVD but I think the difference in price is justifiable.<br />Pros: Great design, easy menu, Blu-ray experience is great<br />Cons: Cheap plastics, loud disc tray","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

I came across this Castle pop-up book at a local chain bookstore [retailing for about 6 bucks] and snapped it up! We were both extremely pleased as the book took us on a journey through a medieval castle and its inner workings. Each page unfolds a pop-up and there are also inserts on each page that one can open to reveal smaller pop-ups [this was a great joy for my little one], One learns about the various parts of a castle, where the different classes of people reside [it was a feudal system with people ascribed certain stations in life, and passed down through birth], One particular pop-up that I found fascinating [and which elicited lots of giggles from my little one] was the mini pop-up explaining how toilets worked in medieval times - so the man poops up above in his fine room, and a lowly peasant shovels it down below and cleans the pit - gross but informative!<br /><br />Another feature I really liked was the pages that portrayed various people at work in their respective occupations - there was a pull the tab feature that showed how a man [atilliator] made a crossbow and a woman worked a spinning wheel.<br /><br />The book also has a full page jousting pop-up scene where a pull-the-tab feature allows one to 'work' the jousters. This was something my daughter really enjoyed!The last pop-up scene features a feast and explains the various dishes, utensils etc used during a feast.<br /><br />All in all, this is a wonderful pop-up book that not only entertains but educates as well.

[Him, I have never met].<br /><br />The book and photo reproductions are of first rate quality. So are the stories, with proper homage to the late, great, Eddie Steele, several of whose photos are used. This is a real journey in a time machine. If you happen to buy your copy there, take it to the \\""Daily Telegraph\\"" office on Bluefield Ave., and Bill will sign it for you. He is a great guy, and a treasure house of local legend.","2008-12-19","2008","Books"

A man kneels in the midst of a small turnout for the show and weeps.  Inspector Perez tries to calm him and the man claims he has amnesia and doesn't know who he is.  The next day, the man is found hanging in a nearby shed--murder or suicide?<br /><br />As the investigation proceeds, the secrets of the past of the few inhabitants of the town begin to surface.  The police team brought in from the mainland pursues what clues there are, while Perez, a local, follows his knowledge of the area and its people.  The contrast is interesting.  Another death of a local celebrity highlights the possibility to Perez that there is more to the case than meets the eye.<br /><br />The books is well-written, the characters well-drawn.  The plot is tight, and the story progresses at a good pace.  Descriptions of the Shetlands and their people are detailed and entrancing.

It is an easy read by someone in the industry. I don't believe you should build a dam or rip one out for the sake of it. I do believe that we should be smarter about deciding whether to build one or to determine whether to rip it out or remodel. Some of the information he shared is not new - the tree rings and over allocation of water has been known for decades the same as backing up water over sand stone and evaporation. He touches on some subjects such as downstream salt issues without discussing why we have built a plant to remove salt from water for Mexico. In other words I believe he provides a good overview of the politics and base issues without getting fanatical. While water usage has been cut in household toilets and such the needs have increased as it is used to cool servers - yes your cloud usage, or the pressures added for increasing crop production for bio-fuels, crop production for food and recreation use (smoking, toking or boating), etc.  Ecosystems were changed when the dams were built better or worse depending on who you talk to. Some of these dams are 50, 75 or 100 years so new ecosystems are in play. He lays a lot on the Bureau of Reclamation but there is plenty to go around, take a look at the Bureau of Indian Affairs Wapato farming discussions in the news today, or the impact of increased almond or outdoor marijuana grows in California on water use. It is a long over due discussion and I like the fact that he has put it out there in an easy to read discussion. Many things are in play right now regarding water, He doesn't cover everything and the issues in this book he talks about for dams apply to other water storage/distribution issues.  Because of discussions and water needs California for example is putting shade balls on its reservoirs to deter evaporation.  Whether you agree with him or not I think you should read this book for his easy to understand writing style on a tough but important subject matter from his personal perspective and his personal experience within the industry.  As with all things finding balance will be a trick.  Thank you Beard for sharing your thoughts and experiences.","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

This book outlines a tried and tested method of growing your wealth long-term and backs up its formula with comprehensive reference to data. This is not a get-rich-quick book, but it does show you that it is possible to secure your financial future by making sensible investments. It also highlights the many pitfalls of investing, notably handing over your money to smooth-talking financial advisors who usually underperform a straightforward investment in stock indexes (and virtually always do so when your factor in their fees, expenses, etc). The message is surprisingly simple: create a diversified portfolio of stock indexes and secure bonds. The book also guides you through the process of setting up your investment.<br /><br />Secondly, the clarity. The book is divided into clear and comprehensive chapters. Each of these is sub-divided into short sections. The overall effect is that the information is easy to process and understand. It also makes it easy to locate key ideas again.<br /><br />Finally, the readability. A book on finance should not, by rights, be a particularly enjoyable read. However, Hallam has a knack for effective metaphors to explain complex ideas, striking images to help the information stick and humorous moments that help leaven the serious underlying message.<br /><br />If you are an expat employee and have any interest in securing your financial future this book is vital reading.","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

I HAVE PUBLISHED A REVISED EDITION OF THIS BOOK.  THE NEW BOOK IS ENTITLED THE SUPER SUMMARY OF WORLD HISTORY REVISED. THE ELECTRONIC EDITION IS DESIGNED FOR THE KINDLE AND SOME OF THE PICTURES AND MAPS ARE IN COLOR ON THE KINDLE FIRE.<br /><br />PLEASE TYPE IN \\""THE SUPER SUMMARY OF WORLD HISTORY REVISED\\"" TO ACCESS THIS NEW VERSION OF THE BOOK.<br /><br />THANK YOU.<br /><br />AD2ext.  The electronic edition on Amazon may have errors the printed version does not have, because the editing was not finished on that draft when it was published AND it was not designed specifically for the Kendal.  There are spelling errors in the book.  The publisher's review could have been better, but all of this in no way takes away from the ideas in the book.  The key here is to understand that the book is basic, and it was written to help folks understand the importance of history.  It is not written for history majors.  It is written for people who want to brush up on history or feel they are out of the loop on history.    All this came about when, several years ago, my own high school age children had never heard of D-Day.  When I inquired about this oversight, they reported they had never been told.  Then it became apparent from people being interviewed on TV that they didn't know anything about history.  One black school teacher actually did not know what the emancipation proclamation was.  Incredible.  (Recently, our own vice president said Roosevelt addressed the public on TV after the crash of 1929 and put everything straight.  How nuts is that?)  So, long before the VP's statement, I decided to write something very basic to try and address the issue of this lack of understanding of even basic history.    Sorry the liberal reader did not like the book.  I say in the opening that I am a conservative Christian, and that comes through in the book.  Anyone reading the little paragraph talking about me on the Amazon page would know I was a US Marine and conservative.  If you can't stand another point of view then don't buy books by people not sharing your world view.  I like reading other points of view.  Hopefully, most people do.

It's surprisingly unemotional for a war story, largely because the participants aren't characterized very well.  The company commander, Dick Winters, and a few others come alive in this story.  Unfortunately, most of the men get about the same treatment as the enlisted man in StarTrek episodes who is doomed to die on the planet.  When death occurs, it's more  matter-of-fact than it should be.<br /><br />The best part of the book comes, surprisingly, in training camp.  Ambrose has time to introduce the regiment to us, and does it well.  The most depressing part of the book comes when the war is over.  One man after another succumbs to automobile accidents, drunken debaucheries, or cases of mistaken identity.<br /><br />So, this book was a disappointment.  I'm sure that the men thought of themselves as a band of brothers but the reasons for that friendship don't come across at all well.","2008-12-19","2008","Books"

Even the general plot is fairly juvenile, obviously targeted towards teen-aged males. And what better way to sell cigarettes to teenagers than to advertise smoking in a sci-fi novel targeted towards teenaged boys? This book must have been paid for by the tobacco industry, as there is a sheer ridiculous amount of chain smoking involved (nearly on every page).<br /><br />Zelazny didn't put much thought into the post-apocalyptic plot, besides the lame midwestern monsters. There seems to be ample cigarettes in an America in economic collapse, as is there plenty of coffee and other items difficult to obtain (eggs, meat, etc).

It is flexible, powerful, and relatively easy to use. The one area of Drupal where I have been weak is theming. Generally, I have used contributed themes, maybe modifying colors, logos, and other simple things.    The one or two times I felt ambitious and tried to read through the documentation in order to learn how to create my own theme from scratch, I either got distracted by life, or found myself getting tired of the search and wishing I had all of the information I needed in one place to learn how to create a theme.    This book has impressed me. It is well-written, using clear language, useful diagrams and figures, and a logical progression of ideas. It starts with the basics, talking about what a theme is and defining its components. Then, it moves into the details of modifying the default themes. Up to this point, I didn't encounter anything new to me, but I was only up to chapter two.    Starting with chapter three, the book reveals and clearly describes each of the files and elements that make up a theme, using both the default PHPTemplate engine as well as other options. Later, the book teaches how to use and master this template engine to create your own custom theme, including how to create custom looks for specific pages, modules, and more.    In between the two, you learn how to download ready-made themes, contributed by the Drupal user and developer community, and modify them for personal use, knowing how and where to look for usage restrictions to avoid problems.    Finally, the book ends with some very useful appendices that show where to find every css file and what it affects, and other useful tooks and kits for developers.    This book has saved me a lot of time, and is well done. If you are responsible for a site powered by Drupal, you may find it useful as well.","2008-12-19","2008","Books"

And while he's getting tips from the gun-toting, wife-stealing Ray, Lester's also trying to make his first moves on Charity, a Louise Brooksalike who turns out to be a lesbian and a friend. But Lester learns more about being a man when a woman from uncle Ray's past collides with Lester's present- and he has to step up to take responsibility where his uncle won't.<br /><br />This novel is a fascinating intersection between the Aughts and the Eighties- the backdrop is very 1984, and some of the attitudes are true to the era, but the novel itself has a very 2008 sensibility to it- accessible to teens whose lifetime Republican president is George W., and who's never seen the Tonight Show with anyone hosting but Jay Leno. It never feels anachronistic, though- Uhlig manages to fuse now with then, with a lot of humor and honesty.<br /><br />Would I Give This Book to a Teen: Absolutely. I think teen boys would feel like they're getting away with something reading this, because of the wicked, frank sexuality- but boys and girls will take away more than illicit thrills. Lester is genuinely complex, and it's a pleasure watching him learn to relate to the people around him.<br /><br />Would I Give This Book to an Adult: Totally depends on the adult. Some of the more... anxious adults might have a problem with a text that admits that straight teenaged boys masturbate (*gasp!*) and like to look at naked women (*shock!*). But I'd be pleased to share it with more reality-based adults, because I think they'd enjoy both the main story, and the complicated histories of the adults going on in the background.ed histories of the adults going on in the background.","2008-12-19","2008","Books"

His father had told him that he would read it before he went away, beyond the enclosure, never to return. His father had taught him many things. How to make akward, declarative sentances. How to kill with violence, when nescessary. When it was good.     Nooly watched Ronald looking at the book. He looked to be interested in it, but is face was frowning. He looked to be thinking about something. Nooly loved Ronald. She had thought for days about how much she cared about him, and had imagined spending dusky evenings eating beans with him while the sun was in the sky. He was a good man. As good as any man she ever knew.     Suddenly, there was a sound in the air. Something happened. Ronald ducked down. Nooly saw him duck. She thought to herself about all of the danger she had ever seen. She realized that a dangerous thing might be above her. She ducked down low, lower even than Ronald. Nearby, a Dirt Person was trying pitifully to scratch out a living in the dirt with primitive, quaint tools. The dangerous thing was on top of the dirt person. The thing cut off the dirt person's hand. Blood was everywhere. The hand was lying in a crimson pool of red blood.     Ronald opened the book. He was the strongest, best person in a five-mile radius. Nooly nervously watched him as blood from the dirt person sprayed everywhere.     Ronald put down the book. \\""I've read this book before. It was not a good book to read.

Jonah starts the work in confidence of his abilities to get this deal done but what he doesn't know is that he has actually become a pawn in an international game of intrigue involving stolen priceless artifacts, a mysterious Faberg&eacute; egg.  As Jonah Gray gets deeper and deeper into uncovering the plot he gets more perilously in trouble losing almost everything he had or earned in the process.<br /><br />I liked the protagonist in this novel.  Jonah Gray is organized, smart, aggressive and speaks in a cock sure manner that gives him the edge in any situation - whether it be a matter of business or a matter of life and death.  The other characters in the story are also well developed and well thought out.  There are no slouches here.  His team at work are complementary to his style.  As details about Jonah's father, Stan Gray, unfold it becomes clear where his intelligence, drive and business sense come from.  I would say that Jonah's nemesis in the story, Andreu Zhamovsky, was also unfolded one leaf at a time so that we could only see his weaknesses toward the end.<br /><br />At the end of the day this book is simply impressive!  Adam Gittlin writes with fluidity and authority.  He has a hard driving style but an intricate plot so my mind was racing throughout the entire story.  I found myself trying to figure out the next move and not upset when a twist in the tale proved me wrong.  And Adam did young Jonah and us a favor:  He left the ending open for a sequel.<br /><br />And I know this is corny but I am going to go on record with it:<br /><br />The Deal is the real deal!","2008-12-19","2008","Books"

Are you unsure how to maximize your talents?<br /><br />If you answered yes to any or all of these questions you would do well to buy \\""The Truth About You: Your Secret to Success\\"" by Marcus Buckingham. This is a book like no other. There are essentially three components. These three components make this book into a highly engaging and effective package.<br /><br />The Components are...<br /><br />*Book<br />*DVD<br />*Memo Pad<br /><br />The first is the book itself. This is all high impact information. The included information is all meat. There are no filler words, sentences, paragraphs or chapters.<br /><br />The second is the included DVD. This should play in most computers and standard DVD players. This is about 20 minutes in length and will engage different parts of your brain.<br /><br />The third component is the \\""rememo\\"" pad. This is what makes this book stand out. You have to take action if you want to succeed. Reading any one book without taking action is unlikely to help you attain a greater level of success.<br /><br />This package will engage more of your brainpower than most other books. Each of the three components engages different parts of your mind. If you are committed to self improvement, you will find this package to be very valuable.<br /><br />The combination of the DVD [audio and video] + the book [reading: visual thinking and processing] and the \\""rememo\\"" pad [thinking, writing, analyzing] makes for a very powerful package.

You'll learn one skill, knit a project and then move on to the next lesson to learn a new skill and knit a new project.  The directions are clear and the drawings/photos are very well done.  You will learn everything from cables and lace to knitting with beads.  The problems with this book are:  1. The yarns used are very expensive.  Also, the patterns are specific to the yarns..silks..angoras...etc.  These projects are beautiful..would they be as nice with more affordable yarn?  If your going to use cheaper yarn, the same types of patterns are available free on the web...no reason to buy the book.  2. The patterns are mainly carnigans and shells.  No socks, mittens, hats etc....this is a book to buy if you are looking to knit clothing for yourself for work or parties.  My advice is buy the book if you want easy directions to knit some very nice classy clothing for yourself.  If, however, you want to go beyond the basics and learn cables, lace etc., using affordable yarn and still make nice clothing and projects - try Knitting Made Easy by Coats and Clark.  It shows the same skills with projects for the whole family - and costs significantly less than this book.

Maybe when you get to the 720th page you'll feel that there are some scenes that could have been eliminated, some scenes that could have gone more smoothly, and some descriptive passages that could have been shortened.<br /><br />But here's what you'll find: Scott Lynch has tried for the picaresque fantasy, and has created for his setting the city of Comorra, which is meant to resemble Venice, although clearly the book is not set on planet earth. This world has multiple moons, ruins of a previous civilization, and sorcery is practiced.<br /><br />It has literary pretensions (it's published by Bantam Spectra, which specializes in that sort of thing), and while it is certainly well-written, Lynch (fortunately) lacks the \\""look at me! I'm writing!\\"" pretentiousness of some of his contemporaries in this field. His grifter-hero, Locke Lamora, is a fascinating rogue, and the plot takes delightful twists and turns. It's not always a fun read, though: some of the scenes, for example when Locke tricks a money-lender out of his fashionable outfit, are amusing, but there are scenes of graphic violence, too.<br /><br />Mr. Lynch has come up with an interesting, but occasionally frustrating, way to tell the tale. He provides \\""interludes,\\"" which flash back to Locke's days as an apprentice to a supposedly blind priest, and he means them to throw some light, and some hints, on the action that is taking place in the book's \\""present.\\"" While they do provide information as to why Locke and his fellow \\""gentlemen bastards\\"" behave as they do, they tend to appear while Locke is hanging from a literary cliff--and some of them don't supply enough information to make the diversion worthwhile, and a few of them seem tossed in simply because, well . . .<br /><br />Notes and asides: First of at least three, but complete in itself.

What just happened to me? Whatever it was, I sure liked it. Knowing this was a work of literary fiction, I expected stylized prose and sophisticated technique that would make me inclined to pause and ponder as I read, regardless of how exciting the storyline turned out to be. I am a very slow reader for one so avid.<br /><br />However, I finished this in just two sittings. The short chapters that jettisoned the reader among the perspectives of the three main characters and to different points in the story kept my attention rapt as I tried to piece things together and see what happened next. The setting, unusual and foreign to my experience, and the novelty of the storyline itself created a totally immersive reading experience. Without sacrificing intensity or depth, the tiny chapters were easily digestible and kept me hungry for more of what author Gabriel Urza was cooking.<br /><br />I wish I could offer more intelligent commentary on his style, but my imagination was entirely captivated by the plot. I definitely recommend to my fellow readers what for me was an incredibly enjoyable read! I look forward to reading this novel again, so that I can appreciate how the technical elements of the author's craft build such a compelling drama.<br /><br />Please be advised I received a free advanced edition of this novel in exchange for publishing an honest review as part of the LibraryThing Early Reviewers program.

I was finally successful and it became one of my all time favorite books that I continually borrowed.  I was delighted when Amazon came on the shopping scene because I was finally able to buy a hardcover copy of this excellent book.  I had bought a trade paperback copy that was literally falling apart.  I searched for years to find a hardback copy of My Thirty Years at the White House and again, Amazon came thru for me.  I adored both of these books and the mini series that it spawned.  I found it facinating to learn about the daily habits of our Presidents and First Lady.  I also began to see how lonely being a President of this country can be and what a burden it is for the members of the President's family.  We actually get to see our Presidents acting like \\""normal\\"" people which of course they are.  Presidents and their families have daily struggles just like the rest of us do and they make mistakes just like normal people.  It is only because of their tenure in the highest office of the land that their struggles and mistakes become front page fodder for all the gossip sheets throughout the country and the world.  I thought it especially endearing that upon being employed as a servant at the White House and especially if you are among the servants that have daily contact with the First Family, they were admondished that gossip is strictly forbidden unless it was already printed in the papers!  We see how the different First Families coped with world wars and personal illnesses.  We see President Wilson drive himself into a furor to get the League of Nations ratified only to see him suffer the debilitating stroke that finished him as President. We see the gentleness of President Taft as he so gallantly shares his clandestine feast with the hungry child Lillian.  We see the strength of character and indomitable will of Maggie Rogers and how she coped with being the wife of an alcoholic who basically left the running of the family to her and she had to bring in the money to take care of them.  We see the family deal with Lillians terrible bout with polio and how emotionally devastated the budding ballarina became after a much needed operation saved her leg from shortening but never to give it life to walk with again.  We see how Maggie makes strong friends, friends that are willing to help her thru whatever trial she faces from learning of the gassing of her only son Emmett Jr. and the death of her beloved husband Emmett Sr. These two books touched me deeply and they continue to remain favorites of mine.  I was delighted when Ed Friendly finally decided to make that wonderful series available on DVD.  It was only aired on television one time.  Rather ironic that Mrs. Kennedy demanded that all White House servants that were on staff during President Kennedy's tenure sign a paper vowing that they would never publish such a \\""tell-all\\"" book while employed or indeed even after their employment.  When I read about that, it just proved to me how true these two books really were and the stories and anecdotes that ran throughout were true.  You can't go wrong in getting either of these two books or the mini series on DVD.  I think they should be required reading in at least a literature class and especially in a history class.  You won't be disappointed in reading these two books.Rogers and how she coped with being the wife of an alcoholic who basically left the running of the family to her and she had to bring in the money to take care of them.

I was delighted when Ed Friendly finally decided to make that wonderful series available on DVD.  It was only aired on television one time.  Rather ironic that Mrs. Kennedy demanded that all White House servants that were on staff during President Kennedy's tenure sign a paper vowing that they would never publish such a \\""tell-all\\"" book while employed or indeed even after their employment.  When I read about that, it just proved to me how true these two books really were and the stories and anecdotes that ran throughout were true.  You can't go wrong in getting either of these two books or the mini series on DVD.  I think they should be required reading in at least a literature class and especially in a history class.  You won't be disappointed in reading these two books.","2008-12-19","2008","Books"

At the behest of Miss Eunice and Fanny Alloway of Persimmon Hallow, Agnes is the new teacher. Agnes was raised by nuns in an orphanage, and has a solid faith in God and is a devoted Catholic. Florida is a world away from the city and Catholic orphanage, but the teaching of Mother Superior was ingrained in Agnes, especially, her advice that preachiness is not Godliness and to not offer advice when it is not sought. Mother Superiors advice to Agnes is sorely tested when she meets Seth Taylor. Seth is the Uncle to young Billy, whom Agnes agreed to watch over on the train until they reached Persimmon Hallow.<br /><br />There is mystery about Agnes flight from the orphanage leaving young orphan Polly, whom she deeply loves and wants to adopt. Agnes’ mystery is eventually revealed as it now concerns Polly. Seth has his own mystery; what happened to make this handsome man lose his faith, become aloof, lonely, and unfriendly to his fellow neighbors and church. I found this very intriguing. As the mystery surrounding Seth is revealed, Agnes finds herself attracted to him.  The extent evil surprised me, as the mysteries were of Seth and Agnes are revealed. The world is truly evil at times as Seth and Agnes discovered. Agnes has great faith in God; Seth avoids anything to do with God.<br /><br />I think the author handles the religious aspect very well; I did not feel preached to but rather was feeling the faith of the character and the scripture from their point of view in the situation in the story. I watched the characters grow in their love of each other, for the community and achieve forgiveness for themselves and others.<br /><br />The town of Persimmon Hallow is a very faith-based hard-working community that is very close. This small town sure has a lot going on; from Agnes and Seth’s mystery’s, shootings, fights, intrigue, engagements for propriety’s sake; the return of evil forces to Agnes and Seth, the plots just keep coming and coming. I couldn’t wait to see what happened next.

It can stand on its own as a story and it sheds light on the complexities of life and culture in antebellum Charleston, South Carolina.      There are people who will never accept any sequel to Mitchell's work as valid.  They are entitled to their opinions, of course.  However, I am of the opinion that there are things that needed to be said in the context of Mitchell's earlier work--and McCain says them in this novel.     For instance, Mitchell herself was such a product of her culture, class and the times in which she lived that she simply did not allow for the fact that most reasonable people would not think that the KKK was a respectable organization or that most would think that the Freedmen's Bureau was not intrinsically evil.  And, while she spends a lot of time describing the hardships suffered by Southern whites during the Reconstruction Era, she makes no mention of the violence done to blacks during that time--beyond their being made dupes of the Radical Republicans.  People of Georgia's working class are usually dismissed with labels like \\""cracker.\\""    Like most current-day students of history, McCaig is not only willing to include the history of people of color and average people generally in his written work, he has deemed it necessary to show how people other than those of the elite class are impacted by the events of their times and how they shape the world in which they live.  In McCaig's book, Southern blacks are real people with real relationships and concerns.  Belle Watling isn't just a prostitute who enjoys Rhett's friendship and occasionally his sexual attention, she is a human being with a relatively normal history and life of her own.  As a result, we are able to understand how she became a madame and what her relationship to Rhett truly is.  People of color and non-elites are not objectified by McCaig;  they are three-dimensional, living beings.    Again, there are people who think that Mitchell's work is sacrosanct and, thus, will never approve of any sequel.  But, for the reader who likes historical fiction about this region and period, for that person who is interested in gaining some insight into those times, I recommend \\""Rhett Butler's People.\\""","2008-12-19","2008","Books"

Most are quite similar, so what we have with DRAIN is writer C.B. Cebulski twisting it around, mixing it up and then turning it upside down, with fine results. Chinatsu's journey of revenge is believable and compelling, made brutally real by Sana Takeda's exceptional 100% digital illustrations. It is amazing what can be done with comic books today and Sana is a leader in pushing the envelope of beauty. Do not expect cookie cutter sequential artwork here. Sana really pushes things here, with each page looking as good as the very best covers, while never failing to push the eye from left to right, as all comic book artists must do.<br /><br />Were this a film, the bloodletting would result in an NC-17 rating, so my only complaint is the convenient hiding of female body parts on certain pages. Are nipples so offensive that they still must be avoided in titles designed for \\""mature readers\\""? Let's get beyond this hangup, shall we. After all, DRAIN's central romance is between two smoking hot women, both possessing large breasts and hour glass curves. This is not your childhood's comic book story. Not even close.<br /><br />This trade paperback is the perfect way for us Americans to experience a damn fine graphic novel. It's just a shame the European readers get to experience this one in their larger format. Sana's art deserves the oversized treatment.","2008-12-19","2008","Books"

In earlier years I have made a point of buying calendars of his masterful, sensitive, and technically excellent images.  They were printed from the large format (probably 8x10 inch) negatives held at the Library of Congress and reproduced superbly.  Printed with the image was a little background on the photo, such as the tribe and some customs of the tribe.  On the days of the calendar itself there were notes of important days in the history of the Native Americans.    This offering has very low quality reproductions of the originals.  The cover photo of the woman with child is justly famous, but this edition is exceptionally poor.  It is not possible to give less than 1 star, but I would if I could.

Most are amusing even, or particularly if they do not accurately reflect the book.  Liar Temptress Soldier Spy chafes the Civil War Cabal, particularly its Secesh branch.  I was tempted to read it and failed to detect its reported pro-union bent.  With forty pages of notes and thirteen of bibliography it surely qualifies as history.  In the preface Ms. Abbott states “anything that appears between quotation marks” is referenced and “characters’ thoughts are gleaned or extrapolated”.  I do not distrust the references and, though I realize she did not attend the events described or somehow directly access the characters’ thoughts, I am satisfied to entertain her inferences rather than generate my own.  There are 427 pages.  One could compute the average number of sentences per page to estimate the total.  There are many.  A few are troubling, particularly those citing Confederate atrocities, which certainly did not actually occur at Bull Run.  But the atrocities did exist as creative inventions Yankee reporters used to fuel hysteria. They are cited in a footnote.  There may be some less egregious “errors”.  I’d like to excise a few sentences from this book, but a few out of how many?  The book is not flawless formal history, but is all the better for its extrapolation.  The writing is extraordinarily good and the book is fun to read.  It is about four women and no critic suggests an alternative source.  Could the irrefutable flaw be that Ms. Abbott is a feminist?","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

Please, make no mistake, those two versions are very very different. Here is an actual interview with the artist asking him this question:<br /><br />\\""IGN Comics: Naturally the first thing many fans will notice is the similarity between your Joker and Heath Ledger's in the Dark Knight. Was that simply happy coincidence, or did the film begin to affect what you and Brian Azzarello were doing?<br /><br />Bermejo: Definitely a coincidence. I certainly don't want to take anything away from Nolan or Ledger, they did something spectacular and iconic with the character, but the reality of this particular situation is simple: Brian and I were already well into this graphic novel when they released the first photo of Ledger. In fact, I was drawing the sequence where Joker walks into the Italian restaurant. I admit, I freaked out when I saw the photo. I immediately called Brian, and I remember he was like, \\""It doesn't really look anything like your Joker.\\"" I still feel like all they really have in common is the carved smile.<br /><br />Honestly, the only thing i can tell you I know for sure is that my version of the Joker, the way you see him in this book, was established long before Ledger was even cast. Just to be clear, this is not to say that Nolan and Co. were informed by my drawing. I've said this before and I really find it to be true, that certain ideas float around at the same time for a reason. Pop culture, social tendencies, fashion, you name it. If you want to do a realistic interpretation of the Joker, there are only a few ways to do it. \\""<br /><br />They are very different. While Ledger's Joker was an agent of chaos, this Joker is a drug addicted mobster who spreads fear wherever he goes.<br />Not that this is a bad thing, it's just different. If you know Azzarelo, then you know how he works. His world is a very very dark and gritty world. A world so real and raw, it can't exist. It's Hyperrealism. And I totally loved it. I loved his interpretation of Harley Quinn most. She's a silent but deadly woman, similar to Luthor's bodyguard. She is also somewhat of a comforting figure to Joker and there's a great scene where you just see him holding her with tears in his eyes, like a child would reaffirming that their relationship is of the mind and not of the body. Interesting enough, though this scene shows that Joker and Harley are not in a sexual relationship, Azzarelo shows us that Joker is still a character with those \\""needs\\"" somewhat. Which is something I really didn't like. It just seems off about the character. I didn't mind the killer croc realism all that much, it worked, and kept Croc imposing, but what got to me was how lame Two Face was. He is \\""said\\"" to be the big boss in this graphic novel, the main antagonist. But it just doesn't strike you as such when you're reading the book. He just seems like a schizophrenic thug, which I guess is what he would be were he real. Come to think about it, he wasn't that imposing in the Dark Knight either.<br /><br />The real treat of this book comes from Batman. Not that he's in it a lot, he only appears at the end. But you feel him the whole way through. The greatest scenes in the book, in my opinion, are when you hear Joker speak of him (and that's what he's referred to as, \\""him\\"", like one would refer to God). You see Joker's side of this never ending battle. You've read countless comics where a villain's on the run and Batman is hot on his trail, solving where he'll be and then closing in on the take down. But what's it like for the villain? Does the villain see it coming? Now you get to see how it's like. You get to see the intuition behind it, how the villain's world starts falling apart. And it is so brilliantly done.<br /><br />Does this all sound good to you? If yes, then get this book, it should be up your alley. And at the price Amazon is sellingit, it's quite the bargain . I didn't speak much of the art, because it isn't an issue in any way. It's quite phenomenal, but it's not the deciding factor in getting this book. The tone and characterization is. Personally, I like my Joker crazy, off drugs (the Joker doesn't need drugs) and asexual. But that's just me.ch of the art, because it isn't an issue in any way.

Like when she had the talent of singer/songwriter Griffin Peterson write a 7 song album that went with her book Maybe Someday. This is one of the many things I love about Colleen Hoover. She brings all these different disciplines of artistic abilities together. Writing is an art, just like painting and songwriting; bringing these different aspects of art together and supporting other artists is pretty amazing to me. These collaborations are beautifully done and Colleen Hoover is a pretty awesome trend setter. I would very much be in support of more authors taking part in collaborations such as these.<br /><br />I love books that have a connection to the art world. For me, art is an extremely intimate and personal expression; I suppose as an artist myself I find a connection in characters that are artists. Owen Gentry is an artist that beautifully paints the confessions of others. Although, I should say that the artist Danny O'Connor's paintings are beautiful. Within the book you will find images of paintings mentioned in the book; adding a unique and intimate element to the story.<br /><br />I was able to create a personal connection with Auburn that caused me to understand so very much of what it was she was feeling. The situation she finds herself in is one that she never could have predicted or been prepared for. She is a young woman doing all that she can to be the best person she can for those she loves. As for Owen, he is doing the same thing. Protecting those he loves. The two of them realize that while protecting and doing everything they can for everyone else, they have sacrificed so much of themselves. They both begin to contemplate just how much of themselves they have given up, and when to say enough is enough. They find strength and courage in each other that they didn't have before and start to fight for a future that is far better than what they have been living.<br /><br />Writing is an art.

Peter Hessler shows the truth within those words in his enlightening book, ORACLE BONES:  A JOURNEY THROUGH TIME IN CHINA.  Not only is the book a travelogue of his excursion abroad, it is a very interesting and progressive observation of East meeting West in a country that has maintained its ancient traditions and cultures amidst the evolution of a booming economy that continues to progress with the rest of the world.<br /><br />But ORACLE BONES is also a commentary on the people of China and its outlying landscape as well as the parallels that Hessler makes with his own experience living and writing as a journalist in Beijing as well as visiting neighboring city of Nanjing.  And as Hessler examines the rich history of a country that many may think they know, there are still hidden histories that only researchers, scholars, and archaeologists may hold the key to revealing the ancient past.  Hessler asserts:  \\""...I conceived of the past as finished, and I imagined history as a straight line of cause and effect.  Historians choose the events that matter, put them in proper order, and then move on.  But the longer I've lived in China, the less neatly everything lines up\\"" (About the book, 8).<br /><br /> Despite the glare of prosperity shining brightly in China, there are still polarized boundaries within the country's colossal geography, culture, people, and politics.  While archaeologists continue to dig and unearth the past, the people grapple with unequivocal obstacles that involve its diverse ethnic make up which points mainly in the Central and Southwestern part of the country.  And this may be seen with the encounters that Hessler experiences with Polat, a Uighur from Xingjiang, Imre Galambos, a scholar of Central Asia descent, William Jefferson Foster who's parents had experienced the Great Leap Forward, and Emily, a student he had taught while teaching English; all of these individuals had an impressionable connection to the western world through popular culture.  But throughout the pages of the book, there is an over abundance of reminders of China's much political past these few as well as the younger generations may never forget because it has left an imprint that resonates in their lives.<br /><br />ORACLE BONES examines China's history from the lens of its past.  From 1999 to 2004, Hessler spent time researching and writing the book with great detail.

I am bibliophile, and a lover of classical english works. This book has a broad selection of nursery rhymes, stories, proverbs, and bible stories. The choices made by the author are interesting, and varied, and I found it interesting to see the orginal forms of some of the rhymes and stories I grew up with.     That being said, I feel I was generous with the rating of three stars, because this book, which claims to be for young children, does not meet the needs of today's child.    The first problem I noted was that the nursery rhymes offered in this book use language that is difficult at best for a little one to understand. Many middle-schoolers would struggle with the choice of words. Granted, I was interested reading the orginal verisons of the poems I grew up with, but I didn't buy this book for me; I bought it for my very young daughter. It will be many, many years before she will be able to comprehend or be interested in these rhymes, and by that time she may be too old to enjoy them at all.     The second problem is that many of these rhymes are obscure and would hold no meaning or interest for child of the 21st century. Rhymes about 'The Woman of Exeter' and ''Candle-Saving' aren't likely to be very understandable to a little child.    Thirdly, the stories offered by the author are also a little obscure and may be hard to follow for its intended audience. However, these, at least, can be made interesting by an intelligent 'bedtime story' reader, and a few are classics which, with a little explanation from you, your child might like.     A fourth, and probably one of the biggest, issue is that pictures are small and not particularly captivating, well-drawn, or bright. I did not find them geared toward my little girl at all, and she, normally so fasincated by visuals, paid little attention to them. As a previous reviewer pointed out, the pictures illistrating the bibical stories are, at best, uninteresting, atworst, they are dark, depressing, hard to make out, and may even frighten an especially imaginative child. All in all, the only reason I did not return this book is because it may be that some of the seniors in my family will find it fun to read the old-fashioned rhymes and because I didn't pay much for it to begin with.     If you, or your older child, are interested in classical english, you will enjoy this tome, but I would not suggest it at all for a 'bedtime' story book for your little one.","2008-12-19","2008","Books"

No need here to backtrack, reread, and move on unsure of what exactly was explained and feel mentally fatigued in the process.<br /><br />The work starts with an excellent build up showing the state of the Republic and the Julii clans fortunes prior to Caesar. Therafter Goldsworthy truly covers every corner of Caesars life. Many would be familiar with his Gallic exploits and the Civil War up till the Et Tu Brutus stage. But this work, while not ignoring that, covers that often overlooked side of Caesar: his youth, his upbringing, education, early efforts to impose himself in the publics eye at any opportunity, and his skillful rise to prominance and the obstacles he overcame (no mean feat given his families almost anonymous and powerless status at the time he was born)which make for every bit as interesting reading as his military prowess. Not only is Caesars political fortunes covered, but those of just about every serious protagonist who affected the political landscape before and during Caesar all of which makes modern politics feel very tame.  The way its all told, does not personalise it like a memoir/biography but as if you are a bystander following anothers progress while being able to take in the sights and sounds of that persons world.<br /><br />All-in-all a work that will provide no end of enjoyment to people just fascinated with Caesar and his world as well as people who just appreciate Roman history and learning about the times. In that respect this book provides as much information on Roman society and its culture,traditions, taboo's and organisation as it does on Caesars life as an added bonus. And it's all so articulate and fluently layed out. Hard to find a flaw with it seriously.ure,traditions, taboo's and organisation as it does on Caesars life as an added bonus.

The story was very unique, and there were plot twists galore -- the kind that has you set down the book for a solid 5 minutes and reevaluate your entire life... you know those kinds?    For starters, I'll tell you about Lia, the main protagonist of this story. I think Lia is the exact type of protagonist that I love to read about, and this is for many reasons. In this book, you get to know that Lia is just a good person through and through. Sometimes with YA characters, you get the good and bad traits, and they tend to (hopefully) overcome those bad traits / decisions at the cessation of the novel. In THE KISS OF DECEPTION, I think the only selfish decision Lia ever makes is the one at the very beginning of the story.    So Lia is the Princess of the Morrighan Kingdom, and as a means to an end, she is offered for marriage to a Prince she has never met, for the sole purpose of forming an alliance between their kingdoms. In the first chapter, the inner turmoil is clear at the prospect of marrying a man she doesn't know, and ultimately giving her life away. So we soon see she had plotted to flee her kingdom on the day of her wedding, with her best friend and then settles in a small, humble village where she starts to make a new life for herself. Now this is the greatest thing about Lia -- she has grown up as a wealthy, learned, doted upon Princess, and now she has put herself into this situation where no one knows who she is, what her true title is, and she becomes a tavern matron. And ya know what? She freaking loves it. She works hard, is grateful to be where she is, and doesn't complain an inch for what she gave up. She's my freaking idol.    Now - the other more interesting plot in this book is the fact that she is not as inconspicuous as she would like to believe. Lia happens across two strangers in the small fishing village she settles in - and thesetwo strangers happen to know exactly who she is. One is an assassin, set upon Princess Lia to kill her and destroy any chance of her marrying the aforementioned prince to form the alliance. The other is the Prince himself, scorned and wondering why his bride never showed on his wedding day, he follows Lia to the small town and settles in himself, pretending to be someone he isn't, in order to better understand the woman who left him standing at the alter. Intriguing, yes?    Not only do we see the story unfold from Lia's POV, but we also have alternating chapters of the Assassin and the Prince, so we not only understand their motivations for tracking the Princess down, but we also get to see Lia through each of their eyes, which is super interesting, and one of my favorite aspects of this book.    And my oh my. The plot twist? Just you wait.    If you want to discuss more, visit the full review at my blog here: (...)

He is one of the founders and pioneers of positioning theory, and also marketing warfare theory.<br /><br />Positioning is creating an image or identity in the minds of the target market for the product, brand, or organization. It is the 'relative competitive comparison' the product occupies in a given market as perceived by the target market.<br /><br />Marketing warfare strategies are a type of strategies, used in business and marketing, that try to draw parallels between business and warfare, and then apply the principles of military strategy to business situations, with competing firms considered as analogous to sides in a military conflict, and market share considered as analogous to the territory which is being fought over.<br /><br />This book covers all basic aspects of marketing in a very friendly manner, with simple, easy to understand real-life examples. The author hates the meaningless buzzwords used by marketers.<br /><br />The author has used a surprising concept of the Genie as a marketing advisor to a CEO of a big public company in a way that the marketing is taught using simple conversations, questions and answers, between the Genie and the CEO. The questions are: What Is the Essence or Marketing? What's Branding All About? What Should Be My Product Strategy? How Do I Get My Pricing Right? Are There Limits to Growth? What is Good Research? How Do I Evaluate Advertising? How Do 1 Pick the Right Medium? How important Are Logos? What Mistakes Are Made Most Often?<br /><br />This concept of using Gene as a mentor is amazing, exciting and amusing. There is a lot of humor, liveliness and variety, as well as caustic satire in the case study analysis. The Genie teaches the marketing via the examples well known to the CEO, i.e. examples involving Bill Gates, Jack Welch, Michael Dell, and the other known persons.<br /><br />I also recommend Peter Drucker's \\""Innovation and Entrepreneurship\\"" in addition to this book. Although the Drucker's writing is on management, not marketing, but it would be a valuable addition to this book.g is on management, not marketing, but it would be a valuable addition to this book.","2008-12-19","2008","Books"

His few and far between knocks to religion are all too trite for me at this point, but I think Dr. Gordon's disdain for tradition shows as well. I have to ask why?<br /><br />Having a 2-year old, I am in the prime time to affect my daughter's moral outlook with my choice of disciplinary training. And we're doing great with spankings. I love her more than anything (except God and hubby) and she's a wonderfully happy child and yes, I've spanked her. But not the satirical image of spanking that Dr. Gordon refers to in his book. The truth is that biblical discipline is to be administered in love, an ideal for which there is no better substitute.<br /><br />The image he portrays is of discipline is anger, with a parent out of control angrily beating a child for punishment. While this was sadly true in our society for many decades, it's out of date for these times. Granted the book is 40 years old now. But more importantly, in fact every biblical reference about child discipline will tell you to love the child while you are punishing. That means no wrath while punishing, explaining to the child (even a 2 year old) what he did wrong, hearing his apology, and having total control over the situation. And most importantly, telling the child you love him. No substitute will do. Either Dr. Gordon is ignorant of this biblical advice, which would be my guess, or he is deliberately distorting the truth to make a point.<br /><br />Though I'll give credit to Dr. Gordon for some techniques I try after reading in his book. Some of which were the exact same as what I learned in pre-marital counseling classes, by the way, general relational/psychological advice. I like the idea to use \\""I\\"" instead of \\""you\\"".  As well as Dr. Gordon's ideas for kids to solve their own problems and be included in decision-making. I will practice that as well. But as far as never \\""preaching\\"" I weep for the generation who doesn't understand right from wrong.

Even then, it wasn't for long, but I found the area fascinating. New Orleans, Gulfport, Mobile and the area around Pensacola are some of the loveliest, most beautiful places I've ever been, with people who are kind, generous and pleasant.<br /><br />But...<br /><br />The grinding poverty needs to be addressed and understood, and it's too often ignored. This is a part of our country that in 2015 has areas as poor, if not in many ways poorer, than some of the worst places you can think of in the Third World. Yes, it sucks to live in a small, impoverished village in a place like Mali, but at least there you're getting some help from the UN, the Clinton Global Initiative and others. We're willing to spend billions (though as a percentage of the federal budget, still a laughably low amount), to help out these Third World countries, but when it comes to helping people here at home we get kind of dicey about it.<br /><br />These people are the sorts you see in this book. People for whom poverty has become a generational cycle. Go to school to break out of it? Sure, but what about when your schools are underfunded, understaffed, and subject to the whims of a populace that is frequently distrustful of intellect and often extremely anti-intellectual? Get a job to break out of it? Sure, but how do you do that when there aren't any jobs to get? This problem is made even worse by a populace that is often quite eager to vote against their class interest. People who are happy to give tax breaks to the wealthy and to corporations. They do so with some sort of &#34;gambler's fallacy&#34; mindset that says, &#34;Maybe this time the people in charge will help us to help ourselves. Maybe.&#34;<br /><br />This isn't even going into the endemic racism that we've been reminded of recently, or the fact that so much of the South still lives, at least mentally, in the Confederacy. In this book, the author encounters a woman who treats a Civil War siege as though it were something that happened to her, personally, and that's something of a problem, given that it was over 150 years ago.<br /><br />I'm not sure what the solutions are to the very, very serious problems of the Deep South, but I am very sure that this book at least outlines what those problems are. It's a great travel book, sure, but it's also an important and entertaining sociological work, reminding us of a part of our own country that's far worse off than many of us can imagine.","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

Primarily about her experiences as an American woman living in the Emirates and teaching at the American University of Sharjah, her writing well illustrates what Thomas Meron meant when he said that a real journey is interior.        That Caesar understands this is clear from her introduction, \\"" Why Don't You Just Stay Home?\\"" as she begins to let the readers into her own past to explain why this book is about a world so different from her native northwestern Pennsylvania. As all skillful writers do, no matter the form or subject, she both educates and entertains in this delightful book, revealing a world so far removed from most of her readers in geography, history, and culture. And yet, like the Emirati culture itself, with its blending of Middle Eastern ways and American pop culture influences, its love for traditions oddly mixed with the latest in gee-whiz postmodern architecture, she has the ability to make the strange familiar and the familiar sometimes oddly strange. A very small example of this can be seen in one of her early explorations of her new desert world as she finds herself wondering at, and wondering about, the differences between the sand dunes there and the lake-effect snowsdrifts of her native home. Less careful observers might dismiss this as a superficial contrast, but it illustrates the curiosity and openness she brings to all her encounters, a willingness to dig beneath the surface for the truths that lie there, taking her readers far beyond what they thought they already knew.        As she begins to try to understand her new land, exploring the cities of Dubai and Sharjah, and the desert lands beyond, she shows that the map truly is not the territory, that to understand the Emirates oftoday, she must reach back into their history, both remembered and re-constructed. She discovers it is not quite what one would think, as she delves further and further back into the past of Sharjah and Dubai. And if J.B. Jackson was right in telling us that the value of history (and he here meant the vernacular history of place) is what it teaches us about the future, then what Caesar lears about the Emirates may reveal less obvious lessons for American readers, both those who travel abroad and those who just stay home, traveling only in their minds.        Not only does she learn about the place but also, and more importantly, the people, and her encounters with her students, as she writes, \\"" teaching and learning across cultures,\\"" are at the very heart of this book, as she explores both the problems and rewards of teaching multiculturally and being multicultural. Her students, too, with a mixture of cultures, backgrounds, and attitudes, find themselves in a different sort of alien world as they explore such works of literature as Ibsen's A Doll's House or Alice Munro's short story, \\"" An Ounce of Cure.\\"" Familiar with American pop culture but without much further experience of the western world, they bring to the study and discussion of the literature points of view that add a new understanding to the works, both for them and for their professor as together they face the task of searching for meaning across cultural gaps. And sometimes, as in the case of A Doll's House or other works in translation, this involves yet a third primary culture, that of the work's author. That Caesar handles this so well illustrates her willingness to be aware of, and accept, those multiple viewpoints, both in her teaching and in herself.        These multiple viewpoints appear throughout the book, as she observes, living within herself somewhere outside her native United States, looking back at her own society with a vision altered by distance and experience. Like Hiawatha's Mittens,she turns the inside outside and the outside inside.        By the end of the book, she again finds herself in the desert--this tim for the Millennium. Here the careful readers may grasp the answer--an answer--to the question posed in the introduction: why didn't she just stay home? And they should be glad she didn't, as I am, that we were invited along for the journey. And, as in her first book, Crossing Borders, she leaves us with a poetic image at the end, a momment caught in time, that makes the whole trip worthwhile.","2008-12-19","2008","Books"

The former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Mohamed ElBaradei stated \\""the nonproliferation treaty is obsolete.\\"" A small country like Israel could be destroyed with a single nuclear bomb. Nuclear weapons in terrorists' arsenals could lead to an Armageddon. Terrorist certainly would have no scruples against using the when available even for reasons of prestige. The danger of nuclear explosion had been effectively managed for several decades, because of the awareness that no side would win a full-blown nuclear war.<br /><br />The NY Times reported (3/16/2015) that after the revolution in Ukraine, in March 2014, President Vladimir V. Putin weighed putting Russia's nuclear arsenal on alert because of his concerns about both anarchy and Western intervention.<br /><br />In today's paradoxical world, there are boundless opportunities for a better future. However, political and racial conflicts, religious fundamentalists, and fanatical ideologists may lead to a global crematorium. It will be much more destructive than the one in Auschwitz. We are living in a time when a perilous situation may turn catastrophic and engulf all of us.

This search for a precedent is quite natural: it is a standard move among students of international affairs and diplomats, who always look for relevant examples, models, and templates in order to understand and to shape the present. After all, many delegates in 1919 came to Paris with books devoted to the Congress of Vienna. The balance of power that Vienna created held for most of the nineteenth century. By contrast, the Paris conference, and the treaty of Versailles to which it led, only brought temporary peace, and was even accused of having planted the seeds of WWII.<br /><br />Richard Holbrooke, who masterminded the Dayton agreement and went on to tell the tale in To End a War, prefaced Margaret MacMillan's book for a reason: as a negotiation practitioner, he studied the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, as he did other international gatherings such as the Geneva talks that led to the end of the Vietnam war and in which he participated as a junior diplomat. This gave him practical insights to stage the Dayton negotiations that are the topic of his aforementioned book. Every detail mattered to him: the shape of the negotiating table (during the 1968 peace talks the Americans had wasted two months arguing over it with the North Vietnamese), the setting of the compound, the choice of audio channels for translation, the eating arrangements, etc. He may have borrowed from Paris in 1919 the recourse to &#34;proximity talks&#34;, whereby the mediator moves between the different parties who rarely meet one another face-to-face. This negotiating technique was used for some sessions of the Paris peace conference, as chronicled by MacMillan.<br /><br />It is said that success is 10 percent talent, and 90 percent hard work. In international negotiations, much of the hard work occurs behind the scenes. Logistics plays a key part, although protocol agents and technicians are not often granted full credit for their contribution. Minor decisions—seating arrangements, the quality of the interpretation, the place where the delegations reside and the way they occupy their leisure time—all have important consequences over the outcome of a negotiation. The names of the treaties that stood up as products of the Paris Peace Conference—Versailles, Trianon, St. Germain, Neuilly and Sevres—all refer to posh places in the outskirts of Paris where meetings were gathered and documents were signed. These locations have kept their charm and distinctiveness to this day. They are certainly not the places that the French have in mind when they use the word “la banlieue,” although they are technically part of it.<br /><br />The reason Versailles was chosen as a location to sign the treaty with Germany was to wipe out the humiliation that had been imposed upon France by the Prussian victors in 1871. The signing ceremony itself proved a logistical conundrum. Each of the Great Powers was awarded sixty places in the Hall of Mirrors at the Versailles Palace. This gave rise to a hunt for tickets, some of them going at exorbitant prices on the black market. The press corps was also in attendance, and it was the first time a signing ceremony was filmed by cameras. Everything was conceived to humiliate the Germans. The train that brought them to France slowed down when it crossed the devastated battlefields where the war of trenches had been fought.  In Versailles, they were quarantined in the barracks where French leaders had stayed in 1871 while they negotiated with Bismarck. After one week, they were summoned to the Trianon Palace Hotel to be handed out the text of thetreaty, with only a fortnight to take it or leave it. The terms were so harsh that even members of the British and the American delegations, including John Maynard Keynes, resigned in protest. At the gallerie des glaces, on June 28th, the two German delegates stood erect, heartsick, as if the hour of death had rang. An American compared the scene to a Roman triumph, with the defeated being dragged behind their conqueror's chariots.<br /><br />Even so, Margaret MacMillan makes the case that the Treaty of Versailles was not excessively harsh on Germany. It certainly didn't cause World War II. In Germany, the Diktat (“dictated treaty”) took the blame for all that was wrong with the economy: high prices, low wages, unemployment, taxes, inflation. But the reparations, which were set afterwards in 1921 and then continuously revised downward, were not a devastating blow: in the final reckoning, Germany paid less to the Allies than what France, with a much smaller economy, paid Germany after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71. The disarmament clauses didn't prevent the Weimar Republic and then the Third Reich to rearm on the sly. The “war guilt clause,” Article 231, which was denounced by German nationalists as the most shameful act of the “peace of shame,” was a standard clause that was also put in the treaties with Austria and Hungary, without becoming an issue.<br /><br />Other treaties negotiated during the Paris conference had more earth-shaking consequences. Empires disappeared, new nations were created, borders were redrawn, cities acquired special status. The treaty of St. Germain officially registered the breakup of the Habsburg Empire, recognizing the independence of Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, and the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (Yugoslavia) and ceding eastern Galicia, Trento, southern Tirol, Trieste, and Istria. It reduced Austria to a small state of 8 million people and allocated former non-German speaking territories to the new states of Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. Under the treaty of Trianon, Hungary lost over two thirds of its territory to Yugoslavia, Romania and Czechslovakia. With the treaty of  Neuilly, Bulgaria lost about 10 percent of its land, including the southern Dobrudja and what it still had of western Thrace, along with its access to the Aegean. The treaty of Sevres abolished the Ottoman Empire and obliged Turkey to renounce all rights over Arab Asia and North Africa. Its Middle Eastern Territories were handed to British and the French as League of Nations mandate. Britain gained mandate of Iraq and Palestine. France gained mandate of Lebanon and Syria.<br /><br />In judging the performance of the peacemakers, a general law seems at work: the closer the territory, the more attention was paid to find workable solutions and equitable outcomes. The farther away from Paris (and from Western Europe), the more catastrophic the outcomes proved to be. The Great Leaders particularly botched their job when they dealt with non-European places, of which they knew little. Japan was allowed to pursue its land-grabbing policy in the Far East. In the Middle East, the seeds of future conflicts were sown, to which there seems to be no end in sight, even today. Even on the European continent, negotiators fell prey to national stereotypes and ethnic profiling. MacMillan reflects on their nineteenth-century preconceptions with a delight that shows these categories are still active in the twenty-first century: “The Poles were dashing and brave, but quite unreasonable; the Rumanians charming and clever, but sadly devious; the Yugoslavs, well, rather Balkan. The Czechs were refreshingly Western.”<br /><br />But even if Versailles and, to a letter extend, St. Germain, Trianon, Neuilly and Sevres are remembered as the outcomes of the peace negotiations, most of the action took place in Paris. This is where logistics comes in again, and what gives the French their main asset for hosting international conferences: Paris will always be Paris. Margaret MacMillan makes a great job of recreating the atmosphere that surrounded the delegates who took part in the negotiation: diplomats of course, but also outside experts such as intelligence officers (all the hotel rooms were rumored to be tapped), university professors whose expertise on regions and ethnicities was often kept idle, Wall Street bankers such as Thomas Lamont and Paul Baruch, journalists emboldened by Woodrow Wilson's point that “open covenants of peace” should be “openly arrived at”, and interlopers of various stripes who claimed to represent the interests of faraway nations and peoples. Almost exclusively men, they found in Paris a promiscuous atmosphere where many distractions were offered: the races at St. Cloud, excellent restaurants if you could afford the price, shows at the Opera, revues and cabarets, and ballroom dancing. As MacMillan notes coyly, “attractive women had a wonderful time in Paris that year.”<br /><br />Wherever the Paris Climat 2015 conference turns out to be a one-in-a-century event or a flop, there are some lessons to be learned from the “six months that changed the world” in Paris 1919. As Holbrooke notes in his foreword, flawed decisions can have terrible consequences, many of which haunt us to this day. Therefore, instead of playing God and taking part in the Creation, designers of a new international order should apply simple rules to limit the negative consequences of their acts: minimize regret, encourage reversibility, build in flexibility and adaptability, defer some decisions in time while front-loading others, go for low-hanging fruits and early harvests, etc. Most importantly, beware general principles, slogans and catchwords. Nowadays climate change negotiators have to grapple with the “common but differentiated responsibility” principle, which sheds more darkness than light.  In 1919, the buzzword was “self-determination” which was invoked like a mantra by all parties but offered little help in choosing between competing nationalisms. “Of all the ideas Wilson brought to Europe,” writes MacMillan, “this concept of self-determination was, and has remained, one of the most controversial and opaque (…) Did he really intend that any people who called themselves a nation should have their own state?” This interrogation is still valid today: with 16,000 existing ethnic groups (by some accounts), can one imagine a world with a similar number of independent polities?<br /><br />As for logistics, it is interesting to note that most of COP21 negotiations will take place in “la banlieue”: not the bourgeois cities of the south-west of Paris, where most of the post-WWI treaties were signed, but in the convention center of Le Bourget Airport, north-northeast of Paris, in the department of Seine-Saint-Denis. This will certainly contribute to the reshaping of the image of France abroad. In 1919, foreign delegates were impressed by Parisian insouciance, joie de vivre, and flirtatious promiscuity. For Puritan Americans whose country was entering Prohibition, the description of Parisian life brought back by delegates and journalists created dual reactions of attractions and repulsion. While a generation of rich American expatriates and bohemians settled in Paris to lead a life of sinful pleasure, others were confirmed in their isolationist tendencies by this image of decadent Old Europe. Similarly, Seine-Saint-Denis now stands in the mind of many Americans as synonymous with Muslim immigrants, derelict housing projects, urban riots, and the failure of the French republican model of integration. My sincere hope is that the success of the Paris Climat 2015 conference may eventually contribute to dispel such stereotypes and to give a more positive image of twenty-first-century France.nd Yugoslavia.

The parishes described are Sorel, St-Ours, and St-Denis adjoining the Rivière Richelieu. The work is organized in eight sections:    1. Introduction: seventeenth-century beginnings  2. The peasant family household  3. Generations of peasants  4. Aristocratic ascendancy  5. The feudal burden  6. The country merchant  7. Habitant-voyageurs  8. Turning the nineteenth century: development or crisis?    The author delivers a 231-page analysis of the local interrelation between habitants (`peasants'), seigneurs (`lords'), and one merchant, with brief glimpses of clergy and tradesmen, all augmented by valuable statistics (marriages, births, deaths, infant mortality, farm size and composition, crop production, etc.) for the specified century, so I'm not complaining (though the text at times seems overly burdened with 20C economic jargon).    The absence of wider context is lamentable. Seigneurs Pierre de St-Ours L'Échaillon, Pierre de Sorel (Saurel), and Claude de Ramezay de La Gesse are only briefly profiled. Post-conquest merchant Samuel Jacobs (an interesting figure who arrived in 1759 with Wolfe) is analyzed, but not compared with pre-conquest merchants like Charles Aubert de LaChesnaye, Charles Bazire, Jacques Le Ber Larose, the Gamelins (Louis, Laurent-Eustache, Ignace), the Babies (Babys), Antoine-Pierre Trottier Desauniers, Louis-Charles Charly St-Ange, etc. `Habitant-voyageurs' traces parish participation in the fur-trade from 1784, but fails to provide any real history (however brief) of the trade itself (by then over 170 years old). Finally, the author doesn't explore why these `lords, peasants, and merchants' emigrated in the first place and stayed despite decades of war with the Iroquois and England.    If the reader seeks facts about three Canadian parishes 1740-1840, this is a valuable study. If a wider portrait of Québec society is desired, this work is helpful but limited.","2008-12-19","2008","Books"

It's an entertaining narrative that introduces you to fascinating characters who have made major biological discoveries, many of whom you've probably heard of and some likely not.

But it reveals itself to be a much deeper story as well, inside the mind of a young woman gripped by buried demons and reckless impulses and at the same time doggedly devoted to a growing spiritual quest to break free and embrace her own wisdom. She makes an engaging heroine who had me alternately cheering her on and then saying aloud, &#34;Nooo!

(Ret.) Dr. Larry C. James, Ph.D. is a nonfiction book about how one army psychologist takes on the task of cleaning up after public relations nightmares at detention centers in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Abu Ghraib, Iraq.<br /><br />Dr. James is sent to reform these prison/detention centers after scandals break out regarding the treatment of prisoners and detainees. After conducting research and reviewing the Stanford Prison Experiment, which details how otherwise \\""good\\"" people can commit atrocities in a prison system, Dr. James heads to Cuba.<br /><br />He outlines some ground rules before he gets to Guantanamo Bay. One of the main rules he sets forth is that leaders must be seen and present. James walks throughout the complex at different hours of the day, even at 2 a.m. He finds that some of the guards on duty in the wee hours are asleep at their posts, while others claim to have never seen a colonel or other military leaders.<br /><br />Dr. James leaves Guantanamo only to be sent shortly thereafter to Abu Ghraib following the highly public denigration of Iraqi prisoners at the detention center. Soldiers at the prison disrobed prisoners, posed them naked in a human pyramid, and shot photos of the incidents, which were later plastered all over the news. As a psychologist, Dr. James was sent to the detention center to clean up the facility and establish protocols to prevent further incidents.<br /><br />The audio of this book was well read and engaging. It certainly kept our attention during our early morning commutes, and it was intriguing to get an insider's look at the military's psychology department and protocols. My husband enjoyed the details about how Dr. James remedied the problems at Abu Ghraib and the insight those details provided about the actual facts of the situation.<br /><br />However, the last chapters of the book slowed down the flow of the book for us. Dr. James offers a great deal of explanation about how the media played up the Abu Ghraib incidents and printed misinformation that maligned the reputations of fellow psychologists and himself. While we understood his need to set the record straight, the information was unnecessary given the timeline he issued throughout the book. Any reports placing him or his colleagues at the detention centers during the scandalous incidents could easily be dismissed.<br /><br />With that being said, anyone interested in military or war history will enjoy this insider's look at the Iraq War, Abu Ghraib, and the military's psychology unit.ow the media played up the Abu Ghraib incidents and printed misinformation that maligned the reputations of fellow psychologists and himself.

This Paratus has his assistant, a wolfhound Rowan, but knows the risks of getting involved with a woman who could be used against him by the evil creatures.<br /><br />Unfortunately Rockhurst finds himself involved with a rather unusual woman - unusual in that she's invisible. He doesn't know the identity of the woman he names Shadow but she saves his life and he wants to find out more about her, especially when he realises her invisibility is caused by a very special ring, one which, if he obtained it, could mean he could once-and-for-all banish the evil creatures against which he battles.<br /><br />But Shadow, otherwise known as Lady Hermione Marlowe, doesn't want to reveal her true identity to Rockhurst, a man she has loved for years. She has met him lots of times and he's ignored her - she's not beautiful or interesting enough to tempt him. After making a wish she finds herself invisible between dusk and dawn and so sets out to learn more about Rockhurst, becoming dragged into his battle against the evil creatures at the same time. What Hermione doesn't know is that Rockhurst may have to kill her to get the ring, and that other people are also after the special magical ring.<br /><br />I did enjoy reading this book, particularly its spirited heroine Hermione. Rockhurst, too, was an interesting and tortured hero although I felt his dog stole a few of his scenes. As a paranormal the occasional lapse of historical accuracy didn't seem to matter as much (people's dialogue slipped into American rather than British English several times). Hermione's fears that Rockhurst wouldn't be interested in her if he actually saw her were well written and I also liked some of the side characters. All in all this was a good read.<br /><br />Originally published for Curled Up With A Good Book © Helen Hancox 2008y published for Curled Up With A Good Book © Helen Hancox 2008","2008-12-19","2008","Books"

Epic in length, engrossing in its details, Ron Chernow's biography of Alexander Hamilton has to be the authoritative account of the great man's life. At nearly 800 pages, it covers his unique upbringing and the insights it brought him into free trade and slavery, along with fascinating details (like how his Sephardic teacher taught him the Decalogue in Hebrew, a lifelong point of pride for the philo-Semite), and the whole trajectory of the country's original and most accomplished meritocrat. Chernow convincingly makes the case that Hamilton was America's prophet, the only one of his generation who saw the country not only for what it was, but what it would become: a free-trading republican democracy that would take the place of Britain in leading the world.<br /><br />However, though the book records his energy, his bubbling ideas, and his titanic achievements, it is hardly hagiographic and lays out his colossal errors in judgment, from the Maria Reynolds affair to the misplaced sense of honor that hurt his political career and ultimately ended his life. Though his accomplishments were far more impressive than any founding father, save Washington, it is difficult to get the sense from Chernow that Hamilton would have made a good president without a powerful legislature or a Washington-like figure keeping his authoritarian impulses in check.<br /><br />Almost always fair-minded, Chernow lays out Hamilton's place in history and portrays the founding generation in their full colors, from the highs of the Federalist Papers to the lows of the Genet affair. Finally, for those readers who already have their favorite founding father (or mother), be forewarned: any fair-minded book on Hamilton will by necessity increase his standing in American history and correspondingly diminish the standing of the other founders - Madison, Adams, and (especially) Jefferson. This book is no exception.","2008-12-19","2008","Books"

While the other series listed are very entertaining and I am so happy to see a revival of reading, I did not find many of them to be as well written or engaging as this series. The His Dark Material trilogy is a fascinating fantasy that has a quick moving, quirky plot that keeps younger readers turning the pages, but it also provides a good bit of mental stimulation for older readers. Combining entertainment, moral dilemmas, building empathy and philosophical dynamics, this book has opened up so many discussions across the ages. It is such a great way to bring the family together for reading and discussion. My only caution is gauge what subject matter is appropriate for younger readers because some parts can get a little scary.

While waiting to make her dream a reality Harriet works as a milliner.  But a difficult customer by the name of Miss Birmingham, who is both spoiled and demanding, costs Harriet her job.<br /><br />Miss Birmingham is convinced that she is destined to marry Mr. Addleshaw. Oliver Addleshaw, who observes the incident between Miss Birmingham and Harriet, feels obligated to offer Harriet a temporary job and inform his not fiancee that an engagement with her is not even a possibility that has entered his mind.<br /><br />But is Harriet willing to present herself as the companion, the fiancee, of the highly eligible Oliver Addleshaw?  All too soon Harriet's life is out of control as she learns the do's and don't's of high society and becomes the topic of society gossip.<br /><br />And there is a secret in Harriet's past that could destroy everything if the truth comes out.  Oliver's future business prospects could dry up and worse Harriet might be forever ruined.<br /><br />After a Fashion is a thoroughly delightful story that is splendid mix of humor, drama, and romance lovingly presented between the covers of this historical fiction book.  Though it is not like the works of Jane Austen something about this book puts me in mind of her Emma.  I enjoyed the interactions between the various characters - especially Harriet and her roommates - Lucetta and Millie.  And I truly loved Abigail Hart and her taking these young ladies under her wings, so to speak.<br /><br />I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher in exchange for my honest review.","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

My Panic attacks started off slowly. Soon they became frequently. And finally it was a 24/7 non stop panic attack. I went to doctors. They prescribed anti anxiety medication. Even that didn't work. Plus I had three young children I was trying to take care of. I was not functioning much. It was indescribable. Very rarely that feeling of complete panic would start to subside for a second or so and I would think, it's going away, only to come back with a vengeance. (Once I read the book I found out I had every symptom possible). I got to the point of not being able to leave my house as well. One day my husband somehow dragged me out for a moment,just long enough for me to go into a store and be &#34;drawn&#34; to this book. I started reading it right there and started crying. I bought this book and brought it home. It became my &#34;Bible&#34;, so to speak. At first while it made total sense, I had many weeks in front of me to actually be &#34;cured&#34;. I didn't think it was 100% possible, but I didn't want to live the way I felt. After reading front to back about three times, it finally started to work. Honestly there are no words in our language to describe the relief I started to feel. The better I felt the easier it all became. Every bit of what she said was totally &#34;spot on&#34; for me. The ups and downs. Sometimes during the very intense part of my panic I would keep reading her words out loud over and over again until the panic started to subside. (If you suffer, literally, from full blown panic attacks as I did you will completely understand what I am saying here). I went to the emergency room once as well thinking it was a heart attack for sure!  They asked me what drugs I took!  I was appalled because at the time I never even took aspirin. It was humiliating. But also terrifying!  Some people that read this book may have much quicker results. I guess it depends on how badly you want to feel better, end your  drama as well as how long you've been suffering. I have given many copies of this book to people who also suffered from panic attacks. One friend of mine got it so quickly and said I'm already cured in a couple days. I was envious but happy for her. The only way this book would not help you to be completely free of panic attacks is if you are simply not willing to give it 100 %. As Dr Weekes quotes, &#34;99.9% is not going to work. 100 % acceptance , at the&#34; PEAK &#34;of panic&#34;.      As another person said, I too wish I could contact Dr Weekes and tell her that she gave me my life back, literally and completely. The concepts are so simple, common sense, yet we don't realize it. After more than 10 years of being completely free of ANY panic attacks, I will say the only drawback for me is that my brain and body &#34;get it&#34; SO COMPLETELY that even when the time comes TO feel a little bit of it (such as almost getting in a car accident, or whatever), my body doesn't react with even the slightest bit of, &#34;fight or flight&#34; pit of your stomach, feeling. Funny because sometimes I wouldn't mind having it a little bit or a normal amount. But nope, no matter what happens and I have alot going on in my life, no panic attacks! I believe completely that this book and there are a couple more books,  should be taught in school. Every person on the planet should be aware of the why and how of panic attacks, what's it's capable and not capable of doing. It would save so much grief for so many people as well as medications. It's the unknown that terrifies us. Knowing basic information is crucial to living a life free of these devastating crazy panic attacks.   I DO want to add that I am no doctor and anyone with the symptoms should of course get checked by their qualified doctor, physician that panic and anxiety IS in fact what is wrong, and there is nothing else medical going on. Dr Weekes also states that in her book.    In closing, the book is worth everyminute and every penny you spend on it. If Dr Claire Weekes reads this somehow, BLESS YOU, THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU, with every bit of my heart and soul. With love and PEACE, Michelle","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

Pandolfini’s one of my authors, and I never miss columns or puzzles, whether online or in “Chess Life,” etc.; and I’ve read nearly all of his books.  These volumes mystify me, because he general produces material of such clear value that these are far from his typical quality of work.  An important points: if you hated these books, don’t think that that reflects the author’s caliber, because it doesn’t.  With that being said, I think it is simple enough for me to suggest that you forget about “Traps and Zaps,” and get something else to help you study up.  I’ll say a word or two more about what I was hoping to get out of the books, so you have some idea why I am very disappointed.<br /><br />What I was looking for was a collection of tactical responses to common mistakes in openings.  There are a couple of those, such as Noah’s Ark traps, and so on.  But the books were largely simplistic puzzle books with bonehead moves, and it is left to the reader to figure out why the move was a mistake.  The emphasis in the title and on the back matter is openings, but the book is a remedial puzzle book, and many of the puzzles don’t have thematic tactical motifs in them.  Basically, if you are given one of these volumes for free and have nothing else to study, or if they are the only chess books your local library possesses (and shame on them, by the way, if that is the case), then going through them isn’t a complete waste of time; however, I can’t imagine a reason I’d recommend these books to anyone.","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

In the first several chapters of Rest, I found what I had been searching for.       Rest offers both an in-depth explanation of how Christians should think about the Sabbath, explaining the Old Testament Sabbath and how Jesus approached the Sabbath. I found it informational as well and formational, and both are important. My questions answered, I felt invited to practice Sabbath in my family in a way that could be warm, attractive, RESTful!

The murals and ethnic eateries of the Mission District, the various bars in the Haight  section with their unique beer offerings, and  the South of Market Street area  (SOMA),  with its many start-ups, and associated food trucks and fine-dining are but a few of the treasure uncovered by this tome.  The fabled &#34;City  Lights&#34; bookstore, located on Colombus Street and overlooking Jack Kerouac  Alley -  all of this is typical Lonely Planet fare, the off the beaten track nature of LP is never more evident than in this little gem of a guidebook.  When one is finally made aware of the complete lack of mention of Fisherman's Wharf, and its jam- packed with tourists adjoining neighborhoods, the realization of the unique perspective of THIS travel guide is firmly borne home.<br /><br />This Lonely Planet offering  is well organized indeed, very well compiled, and contains a great deal of useful information - all compressed into a small bundle of joy.  There is info. on  museums, hiking, scenic drives,, photo opportunities, and lodgings, etc.  The photographs are quite vibrant, and accompanied by such compelling descriptions that most readers would quickly feel motivated to acquaint themselves with  the points recommended by the book. There are many tips surely obtained from locals, for those wine connoisseurs wishing to make the best use of their time in an area rich with wineries and all things wine. Having lived in the  SF Bay Area for many years, I can assure you that the maps are not only correct, and indicative of the very best routes to follow, but that there are a number of different maps, cross-correlated to other maps - all leading you to the very best of local delights.<br /><br />As a  former local myself, I can say with authority that the descriptions and suggestions are accurate, to a &#34;T&#34;.  For example, if one wishes to tour and taste the very best of American-made sparkling wines :  Korbel and Mumm's, the two superb examples of American produced sparkling wine ( Champagne, although it is illegal to use that description for a sparkling wine not made in that region iof France), that can be done. There  are vividly painted portraits of the two wineries, and the tours and tastings offered there. In Sausalito, a lovely city across the Bay Bridge from San Franciso, there are particularly noteworthy descriptions of restaurants and art galleries, also included is the luscious restaurant &#34;Fish&#34;. This restaurant's inclusion in the book is alone worth the purchase price. &#34;Fish&#34;  offers gorgeous incarnations of the very best dishes, prepared in the international and traditional manners of both the French and  the California-style Nouvelle Cuisine, carefully making use of only the very freshest, locally sourced, and sustainable ingredients of the region.<br /><br />The gloriously lovely local scenery receives its fair share of beautifully written suggestions, useful for walkers, hikers and cyclists, as well as for those who prefer to savor this area by car. The Russian River, Napa, Sonoma, The Marin Headlands, and Muir Woods are among the most glorious and  worthwhile &#34;Don't Miss&#34; sites which receive particularly well-appointed descriptions and maps. The aforementioned areas are indeed splendid, even local residents can not visit them often enough. I would highly recommend that those areas be included during  the formulation of travel plans to the Bay Area and beyond.<br /><br />The title is rather misleading, this book actually covers only SF,  Marin, and the wine regions. Marin County and the Wine Country are not, strictly speaking, generally considered to be a part of the San Francisco Bay Area. However, the book is so lovely and jam-packed with intriguing suggestions, inspiring photographs, tips, and &#34; Must Visit&#34; pointers, that the rather misleading title can well  be forgiven. There is a mouth-watering description of the leading, premier, and ground-breaking shrine to California Nouvelle Cuisine :  Alice Waters'  &#34;Chez Panisse&#34; restaurant. This truly historic eatery, located in the East Bay city of Berkeley, has consistently forged ahead with its strict adherence  to the code of using only the freshest, in season, sustainably farmed, and lovingly reared ingredients. A chance to visit this Mecca of American foodies is not to be missed. The culinary offerings there are of such complexity, and yet presented with such simplicity and honest regard for  the palates of those fortunate enough to dine there, that this is indeed a point of pilgrimage. &#34;Chez Panisse&#34; was among the first of American restaurants in the 70's to toss aside the rigid  formats of what French cooking had evolved into in America, replacing that with a TRULY American example of fine dining.<br /><br />Lonely Planet is an appellation to be trusted, whether it be placed upon books, travel guides, maps, calendars, or any other of the many offerings that have earned the right to be ranked in the top tier of  premier travel paraphernalia in the world.

I recommend this book to one and all as being a representation of a rather familiar area, one that is transformed by this book into a journey of carefully revealed, polished, and heretofore unseen delights.  .","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

Former director of Development Research at the World Bank and advisor to the British government's Commission on Africa, he is one of the world's leading experts on African economies, and he has penned a comprehensive book on ways to lift the billion or so people living in failed or failing states into the 21st century.    Collier points out why this is important to us not just to the billion people who are living and dying in 14th Century conditions. With globalization and the flattening of the world the twenty first century world of material comfort, global travel, and economic interdependence will become increasingly vulnerable to these failed or failing states of chaos.  As the bottom billion diverges from in increasingly sophisticated world economy, integration will become harder, not easier.    This book focuses on the 4 traps that keep the bottom countries from moving upward.  These traps are: the conflict trap, the natural resources trap, the trap of being land locked with bad neighbors, and the trap of bad governance in a small country.  Collier believes the best way to beat these traps is through economic growth.  Collier provides a couple of recommendations for helping the poor: \\""narrow the target and broaden the instruments.\\"" Narrowing the target means focusing on the one billion of the world's people (70% of whom are in Africa) that are going nowhere fast. Broadening the instruments means shifting focus from aid to an arsenal of policy instruments such as better delivery of aid, occasional military intervention, international charters, and smarter trade policy.    Collier uses statistical analysis to prove many of his points, some of which are surprising in their outcomes.  His list of experts who assisted him in this endeavor contributes immensely to the overall analysis and findings and givesthe reader the impression that there is valid credibility in his work and findings.  The best part of the book concerns Colliers thoughts on Globalization.  Collier believes Globalization's effects on economies comes from three distinct process: trade in goods, flows of capital, and lastly the migration of people.  Collier develops these themes and sheds some interesting light on the problems of the underdeveloped nations of the world.    Although Collier does not use foot notes, he does provide a list of research that contributed to this book.  Collier also points out which research projects have undergone the scrutiny of his peers, and which research has not and leaves it up to the reader to decide on the validity.     The Bottom Billion is a very readable book, 192 pages, and provides the reader with some expert analysis and recommendations for assisting the failing nations of the world.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a comprehensive look at why states fail and how to assist them in their efforts to grow.","2008-12-19","2008","Books"

Fuller calls attention to the debacle after Munich, and how the USSR was ready to intervene with the Allies to stop Hitler.  But the Allies folded, and now Stalin perceived it was best for him to side with Hitler - and least for the moment.  In 1939 the picture had changed, and England and France knew it.  They also knew they could not significantly help Poland.  Also, their decision was an abrupt change in policy which caught Hitler by surprise (so says Fuller) and he could not be expected to change his foreign policy so quickly.<br /><br />I do not agree with every point Fuller makes.  For instance, I think Hitler was given many diplomatic warnings after he took over Checkoslovakia so the change in Allied position could not have been unexpected.  But my criticism is beside the point.  What JFC Fuller makes the reader do is THINK.  And that is what history is all about.<br /><br />All through the book the author examines the tactics and strategy of the two sides from an expert's point of view.  And he is an expert.  This book was published before the secrets of Ultra and Magic were revealed, and Fuller decided not to alter his book (published in 1947) because of the new information.  He decided his analysis was correct and the new information did not change his strategic thoughts.  That is how broad his strategic thinking is - even something so important as Ultra did not throw off his big picture examination of the war.<br /><br />A great book!<br /><br />AD2","2008-12-19","2008","Books"

My heart is to raise children aware of the needs around them. Amy so beautifully calls us to not only be aware, but to respond, and yet, she doesn't leave us there. She provides rationale, resources, personal stories, and where the heart to serve begins: 31 Days of Growing Giving Hearts (with Bible references). You don't have to share her faith in Christ to learn from her example, her soul search, and her growth in this area, but you will definitely be blessed by the way her faith informs her every step. You will hear from almost her entire family, in one way or another, in this book, and she leaves you with not only an honest view of the battle to be intentionally giving, but the blessings as well. After sharing her heartbeat and mission, she offers links to charity organizations and the web sites that rate them. Her book can get you started in making a difference or help you see where you can try something new, extending your reach a little further. Whatever the case, it's about the world, but it's also about the difference some purposeful choices can make in each and every family.  --Bonnie Lyn Smith, Author of &#34;Not Just on Sundays: Seeking God's Purpose in Each New Day&#34;","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

She starts the book by talking about how we should not interfere in other people's lives and then each chapter seems to have something to do with working on our own lives vs. worrying about other people's lives.<br /><br />From what I can tell from her own experiences she grew up with very controlling people trying to run her life. This book takes a completely different direction, it almost preaches: \\""withdrawal.\\"" This might be fine for some people who are not in a relationship or who don't have kids. I believe you need to be active in your relationships and not neglectful. What happens if your kids are on drugs, should you not \\""interfere.\\"" I would take the chance to save my kid's life.<br /><br />While the advice is good at times I did disagree with this sentence: \\""I also suggest that whenever thoughts of the future come into your mind, you envision blowing them away.\\"" ~ pg. 29 Many spiritual teachers would tell you just the opposite and that you should visualize your future which then leads to success.<br /><br />If you are traveling along a spiritual path (and all of us are in some way) then many of the ideas in this book may seem familiar to you. As you read each chapter you can do your own reality check to see where you are in regards to the advice given. For example, the advice on never arguing seems like good advice but it is probably never going to happen. You are probably still going to argue sometimes even if you try to avoid all negative experiences.<br /><br />What I appreciated most about this book was the fact that we can make positive choices that will better our lives. Karen Casey guides you through each step so you can analyze your current life and find out what changes need to be made.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review","2008-12-19","2008","Books"

I am a big fan of his Confederate Uncle James Dunwoody Bulloch (1823 - 1901), the man who, almost single-handed, organised the building and the cruising of the CSS Alabama that, in  turn, nearly turned the tide in 'The War for Southern Independence.'<br /><br />(Captain Bulloch died in exile in Liverpool in 1901 at the age of 77. In his will he left $30,000 to his nephew, Theodore Roosevelt, soon to become the 26th US President. His gravestone is inscribed \\""an American by birth, an Englishman by choice\\"").<br /><br />There is little doubt that Roosevelt was proud of his Southern relatives and his Southern blood, though he was, through his paternal line, an instinctive Northerner (not necessarily a dyed-in-the-wool Yankee, though he went to Harvard and was Republican in much of his politics).<br /><br />Anyway, my first subject-specific Roosevelt reading was David McCullough's 'Mornings On Horseback,' a marvellously moving account of TR's tortured childhood and younger manhood. There is little doubt that the first President Roosevelt was a complex and intriguing figure as well as being attractive in his own right, notwithstanding any of his amazing political achievements. I don't much care for Republicans but, from a very mixed bunch, it is easy to select TR and Ronald Reagan as having been hugely successful and it is very fitting that the former should have had his visage carved by Gutzon Borglum at Mount Rushmore. (There seems to me to be a strong case for the latter to be likewise immortalised).<br /><br />I told my better-educated and extremely well-read brother-in-law of my growing interest in TR and he promptly lent me two more volumes, the twin subjects of this review, Edmund Morris's 'The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt' and 'Theodore Rex,' which deal in sequence (and do read them in sequence, please) with TR's life until September, 1901, when an assassin did for William McKinley in Buffalo, New York, and TR was translated from Vice-President to President.<br /><br />The two books are big 'uns - 920 pages and 772 pages respectively - and they are thoroughly researched (with extensive notes in each case) as well as being beautifully written. Edmund Morris is evidently an extremely well-read author and his subject was obviously an amazingly well-read gentleman. The books are not just about being learned and being successful in politics and statecraft, however, for TR's life was so full of adventure, too, and, even if he had not been President, such a man would have justified and merited any number of biographies.<br /><br />What did I learn? Well, I learned more about New York City and some of its more shady inhabitants; I learned more about Harvard and its habits and habitu&eacute;s; I learned more about the truly Wild West; I learned more about New York State politics; I learned more about the increasing influence of the United States in the latter part of the nineteenth century; and I learned about some people of whom I had never before heard - Marcus Alonzo Hanna, Elihu Root, Philander Chase Knox, Joseph Benson Foraker and Archibald Willingham de Graffenreid Butt - and, no, I have not invented any of these gloriously-named men - as well as some of whom I had heard, such as William Jennings Bryan, the Democrat who might have been a successful Presidential Candidate (and a successful President) had he not been faced with TR or TR's man, William Howard Taft.<br /><br />And what are my conclusions after so much enjoyable reading? Well, first, I believe that TR made a big mistake in not seeking a second elected term - and possibly a third, for it was perfectly legal then - as a Republican: he was a better man than the fat and lazy Taft and the world's history may have been very different had TR been around to counter the Kaiser instead of the useless Taft or the over-intellectual and over-idealistic Woodrow Wilson; second, it has become obvious to me that TR was nothing short of brilliant in his dealings with such as the Panama and Venezuela crises; and, third, it is just possible that there may have been more to TR's relationship with the charismatic Archie Butt who was to die an heroic death when the Titanic went down. How 'bully' it would have been if the vigorously masculine and ultra-heterosexual TR had discovered a different sort of closeness to the unmarried Butt.<br /><br />I cannot wait much longer for Edmund Morris's projected third volume on TR: a buyer awaits its emergence here in England!ealings with such as the Panama and Venezuela crises; and, third, it is just possible that there may have been more to TR's relationship with the charismatic Archie Butt who was to die an heroic death when the Titanic went down.

He repeatedly advises that these people seek other counseling. That pet loss counseling won't help them.     I can't imagine there exists a single adult human in the world without baggage, regrets, unresolved grief of some kind. Of course a new loss brings up past matters. Of course grief can be a complex affair. And of course there are vast numbers of lonely people in the world. The author seems to have a fantasy of being able to treat perfectly healthy humans through a few weeks of grief.     If you are in the vulnerable state of grief, you deserve to be treated more gently and thoughtfully. And if you do need extra counseling to cope with any the past issues a new loss brings up, you deserve to be positively encouraged to do so, not told that you are an impending disaster when you are so fragile.     The suggestions at the end contain some useful coping strategies, but they include the consideration of a job change or move. This is inexplicable.","2008-12-19","2008","Books"

However, the grass isn’t always greener on the other side, or is it?<br />As you read, you see that Dinah is not the same person she was in the last installment but still has her own charm that you cannot help but love. She is suffering from post-traumatic stress (PTSD) from the events of the last book and has to confront it and many other things from her past, including the negative sides that come along with it, such as the elevated lack of confidence and self-doubt when it comes to certain situations.<br />What this book introduced, in regard to the story, was the change of perspectives.

So I am not a member of Slingerland's target audience for this book.  But precisely because of this background I found the book fascinating.  Among my friends Slingerland's arguments in favor of what he calls \\""physicalism\\"" are taken for granted. But Slingerland travels in different circles. Apparently among humanists far from being taken for granted these arguments are either unknown or ignored.  Slingerland's stated intention is to demonstrate to humanists that they need to incorporate empirical knowledge, specifically cognitive science into their work. Looking at the \\""also bought\\"" list here I see mostly books on cognitive science and very few works on humanist subjects.  This suggests to me that his target audience isn't buying this book.    The best sections of the book are those where Slingerland applies his physicalism to humanist subjects.  For example he discusses how empirically grounded reasoning interacts with religion. The argument is almost circular.  He applies empirical reasoning to discuss how religions non-empirical reasoning works.  If you don't accept empirical reasoning in the first place (which I gather many of his humanist colleagues don't) then you have no reason to accept this discussion.  But he is saved from circularity by a prior discussion of why, by virtue of the way our brains evolved, humans favor empirical reasoning.","2008-12-19","2008","Books"

But Todd got an eye opening glimpse of Colin shifting at the end of the last story, so that when they try to keep the supernatural details pertaing to their the latest serial killer case from him yet again, Todd demands the truth.<br /><br />Our heroine is luscious Cara Maloan, a succubus who has sworn off sex until she meets Todd. Somehow she can't resist him, especially when she discovers that Todd is immune to her 'demon' mind control and she realises that what she has with Todd will not be another meaningless romp with a 'sexual puppet'.  So, though Todd is drawn by lure of Cara's addictive scent, he is fully able to hold his own against a woman he desires like none he's met before.  So what's the problem?  The killer's victims are men found naked and bound and drained of their life force with a sex-demon's mark on their chest and Cara's the only succubus in town.<br /><br />I loved Todd as he adjusts to the discovery that there is so much more to the world, it something he's always sensed and it turns out that Todd also has 'a little extra'.

Told through the eyes of 25 year old Danny, who has suffered tragic losses and is dealing with grief and death all around him, this story draws the reader in and compels the reader to keep reading.<br /><br />Danny himself reminded me a bit of St. Francis of Assisi. Danny's a sort of fool for God, singing and fasting, loving and trying to do God's will. The religious part of the story, I thought, was really well done, not preachy, not pushy, just there as a natural element in the work. But just as many were and are drawn to the simplicity and wonder of St. Francis, so many will be drawn to Danny Gospel.<br /><br />Danny Gospel deals with death and loss in a real way. Danny Gospel's entire story is of real encounters with people: friends, brother, neighbors and strangers who help Danny become the loving person he is, and safely see him beyond his tragedies into new life, friendships, forgiveness, and love.<br /><br />Danny Gospel is an emotional story. Danny feels deeply, loves strongly, prays quietly and acts firmly on the promptings of the spirit.

However, Boyd's argument is deeply flawed in a number of troubling ways. Throughout the book, Boyd frequently 'argues from silence,' meaning that he takes inaction from Jesus to be a call to inaction from ourselves. Jesus never troubled himself over the conduct of Roman rulers, Boyd argues, so we too should not trouble ourselves with how our 'rulers' behave. Well, Jesus also never mentioned cellular phones, but I'm pretty sure he's okay with us using them. Even if you do accept an argument from silence however, it is not valid in this case. Jesus frequently spoke out against hypocrisy, lying, and oppression, all of which (and more) the Roman rulers were guilty of. Simply because Jesus did not preface his comments with, \\""Now, about those Roman rulers...\\"" does not mean He did not care about their behavior. God cares about everyone's behavior, whether or not Jesus specifically and directly addressed their own subgroup.   Boyd's book is shockingly thin in scriptural references, and several counterarguments from scripture are ignored outright. Boyd speaks over and over again about God's hatred of violence, yet never once mentions the divinely ordered Old Testament wars. Boyd is so determined to make his case that he, ironically, severely undermines himself by refusing to even mention, much less explain, this and other obvious counterarguments. When Boyd does find a scripture that bolsters his argument, he often gives the passage much more importance than the Bible itself does. As one example, he uses the one verse saying 'love is not rude' to mean that we as Christians should never be rude - and opposing evil is rude, Boyd says. He makes no room at all for the idea that perhaps opposing evil is more important than manners, or eventhat sin can be corrected in a way that is not rude. Nope, love is not rude, and that is that, according to Boyd.  Boyd also severely oversimplifies several nuanced, complicated passages, as in his claim that 'Satan is CEO of all world governments.' Boyd argues this claim as a central point of his book, yet the scripture he takes it from (Jesus's temptation in the desert) is not nearly as clean-cut as Boyd has decided it is. I grant that Boyd is possibly correct in his interpretation of this passage, but it is just as likely that he is not. I am not willing to change my worldview based on one unclear passage, although Boyd would like me to be. Bottom line, Boyd is sloppy in his use of scripture throughout this book, which I find deeply troubling.     This book also has numerous internal inconsistencies, to the point that I am quite surprised it was even published in this form. Remember that 'Satan as CEO' argument? Boyd himself refutes it in the final chapter of the book when he discusses God working through nations to achieve His divine purposes. Boyd repeatedly argues against Christians involving themselves in the government (Satan is in charge, after all), but Boyd wants us to vote. Why should we vote? So good can be worked through the government - no mention in this part of Satan being in charge. And how are we to know what to vote for? Our conscience, of course. And where does our conscience come from? This is never answered, but it must not be from God, because God doesn't want us to be involved with the government. Yet somehow without God we are still supposed to know what is good and should be voted for. Boyd really does make all these clearly contradictory arguments. He repeatedly undercuts himself, and he doesn't even realize it.  Bottom line, although I do agree with a few of Boyd's arguments, most are sloppy, his use of scripture haphazard at best and more often profoundly troubling, and he can't even construct a coherent argument. I absolutely do not recommend this book.","2008-12-19","2008","Books"

True, it's an unusual title, however when you read the book you'll understand the significance.<br /><br />The story is about two young brothers, 9 year old Molar (named after the tooth - his father is an Orthodontist) and Aaron, age 11. Like many children around the holiday the brother got caught up in the commercialism of the season and had a wish list a mile long (not unlike my 'tween daughter).<br /><br />The day after Thanksgiving the boy's father takes them to the mall to meet Santa, who unbeknown to them Santa is really Dr. Ringle, a Pediatric Oncologist and also a friend of their father. Santa (Dr. Ringle) tells the boys to meet him at a local Children's Hospital where they will find everything they ever wanted for Christmas.<br /><br />Once at the hospital the boys are assigned the task of playing Elves to Santa and assisting Santa. While at the hospital the boys make friends with some of the patients while getting ready to participate in the hospital's Christmas pageant.<br /><br />Aaron befriends a young boy name Madhu who is in desperate need of a transplant. Madhu has lots and lots of questions about Christmas for Aaron and he wants to play the part of the fourth Wise Man so that he can give a special gift to baby Jesus.<br /><br />Molar, or Mo, becomes friends with a little girl name Katrina. She's had many surgeries and as a result she is covered in scars. She's is a very sad and lonely little girl who wears a paper bag over her had so that no one can see the damage to her face.<br /><br />Without giving away the ending (but I'm sure you can sort of figure it out) the boys finally learn what Christmas is truly about. It's not about the latest and greatest video game, or $120+ Ugg boots (hello my dear sweet daughter!). Christmas is about love, friendship, caring and giving. Just as the Wise Men gave gifts to baby Jesus, Katrina, Madhu and the other children at the Pediatric Hospital gave Mo and Aaron the great Christmas of all by showing them the TRUE meaning of Christmas.<br /><br />This is one of those books that I like to refer to as a \\""keeper\\"". I will be re-reading this book every Christmas. Let me forewarn you that this book will make you cry, but in a good way.<br /><br />I recommend giving this book to anyone you know who is caught up with the commericalism of the holiday as a reminder to think about the real reason for this season.

The implication, if one has read the Foundation series, is that this group eventually becomes the Galactic Empire of the Foundation novels and Pebble in the Sky; called the Trantorian Empire in The Currents of Space.  It is called that because it is based on the planet of Trantor, which is the closest habitable planet to the center of the galaxy.

No book of this genre can truly speak to individual readers but this one comes close to touching on many aspects without making me think, &#34;That's not my case, it's a waste of my time.&#34; I started out reading books on building self confidence, then quickly realized it's not my lack of self confidence but the constant emotional excursions and defeating talks from my mother that I accommodated my whole life, leading to the &#34;new normal&#34; for me. It's written in straightforward language without talking down to the reader, the only reason it took me over a month to finish reading is because of how painful it was to acknowledge and grieve along the way. This books has exercise, worksheets, and helpful suggestions. It touches on every aspect including childhood, adulthood, letting go if you can't get closure, whether you choose to confront the BPD parent, whether you still want them in your life or not, how to handle family and friends who don't want to acknowledge your experience, grieving the parent and childhood you wished to have, etc. I've learned to say &#34;It's complicated&#34; and decline to talk about it when certain people ask how my mother is doing.

He has developed a short-hand system of graphic images that are powerful and archetypal. He evokes not only the gods of the primitive cultures he studies but also evokes a symbolism and a mythic narrative akin to Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell.    The image of the warrior male is superb in both its graphic, symbolic, and narrative functions within the works of Jose Bedia. The works are highly graphic, with the power that exceeds that of comic books in explicit form. The narrative aspects of the works seem both familiar and mysterious.  The male torso, so often represented in the strained rib cage of Christ on the cross, appears in Bedia's work.  Like Roger Brown, he stylizes the images and brush strokes, not only because primitive cultures evolve to the point of one strong representation of a particular image, but also for purposes of repetition and rhythm. The power of his images is monumental, concrete, and grounded in form.     I find I react at a physical, emotional, and psychic level to his work, possibly because he has boiled down the image and narrative to an essential essence. In the work \\""Mama Wants Blood, Blood of his Bull\\"" the image is so powerful as to evoke dreams. In \\""Vision of the Island from Afar\\"" we see a figure that is also a monumental cluster of mountains arising from the water. Stick-like trees seem like ornaments on this giant nude giant. In \\""All Life Like This\\"" we see on a semicircular canvas the classic image of the tightrope walker above a chasm of deadly points, or hills, their threat emphasized with peeping skulls. In \\""The Great Fisherman\\"" his highly graphic stylized image of giant hands deconstruct into hundreds of black fish. His installations are very powerful, the image of the male warrior dominating the spaces asa protector, shaman.  The limitation of his color range only adds to his power as black on white paintings are so graphic that color might only lessen the effects.  The influence of multiple cultures is synthesized in Bedia's work, rarely appearing in an painting as an image that had not been fully integrated into his vernacular. Rarely can a viewer look at an image and clearly identify the culture from which the image may have arisen since Bedia appears to be able to quickly absorb the images of other times, cultures, peoples, artists, and make them his own, a gift akin to the gifts of Picasso. The semicircular and circular paintings have the effect of myth and folk tale on the viewer, both simple and yet complex, both overt and yet hidden. It would be  mistake to think of these works as only graphic stick men since there are painterly aspects to most of the paintings.  Later works evoke modern images of aircraft carriers cutting the waves and yet these images still seem to hark back to more primitive and basic instincts.     The book is truly beautiful, with three informative essays, a detailed chronology of the life and works of Bedia, and a wonderful photography section revealing the personal life of the artist, his family, and his collections of primitive art forms. In my opinion Bedia is a major artist as this monograph clearly documents.","2008-12-19","2008","Books"

It seeks to demonstrate through historical analysis that Islam and the West are part of the same culture, and that there has never been a “clash of civilizations” (an influential if controversial theory propounded in 1993 by Samuel Huntington).<br /><br />The authors instead lean toward Richard Bulliet’s theory of the “Islamo-Christian civilization,” drawing on the religious, cultural and intellectual heritage of the ancient Mediterranean and the Middle East and fostered by centuries of migration and trade.<br /><br />They do not set forth a grand theory or manifesto; instead they concentrate on the nitty-gritty of history, the down-to-earth interactions that make up the bigger picture: for example, dealings between the Genoese and Tunisians, the Catalans and Maghrebis, and the influential cultural capitals Constantinople and Alexandria.<br /><br />Tolan, in the first part of the book, focuses on the medieval period, Veinstein follows with chapters on the 15th-18th centuries and Laurens then focuses on the contemporary era.<br /><br />They show that the Mediterranean and the Middle East were in a constant state of cross-fertilization. The classical Greeks learned science and art from ancient Babylon and Egypt. A millennium and a half later, the Muslim Abbasid empire, based in Mesopotamia, translated Greek classics into Arabic and reabsorbed their knowledge into the Middle East. These three authors demonstrate that the ebb and flow of human knowledge, culture and social relationships is massively tidal and ultimately relentless.<br /><br />(A version of this review appeared in Aramco World Magazine, Mar/Apr 2015.)","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

A lot of people I knew always put this show down. Many people said these girls just wanted attention and they were really horrible people. Hearing people say this about these shows always shocked me and made me feel uncomfortable about admitting that I watched every single episode of every single season. But those were the old days, now I am completely comfortable admitting that I watch all of these shows.<br /><br />To be completely honest, I started watching back in high school because I thought it was a good idea. I figured it would be a good way to make sure at least I never became a teen mom. Not that I had many boyfriends in high school but watching the show ensured that I was more responsible than I already thought I was. Watching these girls get pregnant at a young age, and struggle through their lives with new babies, and schools, and jobs really opened my eyes at such a young age. I was very inspired by each and every one of these girls for different reasons.<br /><br />Anyways lets get to Maci's story at hand. Out of all the girls I watched on TV Maci has by far always been one of my favorites. I loved how much of a good mom she was to Bentley no matter how hard it was to get pregnant and have a baby at such a young age. She was responsible enough to finish high school before she even had Bentley. As well as getting jobs here and there and going to school on and off until she finally graduated college recently. Her graduating really inspired me to work hard at school even though I do not have a baby.<br /><br />I am so glad I got to read her story. From falling in love with Ryan all the way to falling in love with Taylor and having Jayde. I feel even more connected to her more now after reading her story then just after seeing it on TV. Definitely give this a read, its really inspiring.its really inspiring.","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

I can see now why this book would be more difficult to bring into the series as it is set, mainly, in Riga in 1992 where life was a little different from that of today - to say the least.    I remember my days in Eastern Europe and Mankell conveys the grimy atmosphere of the State police rather well. My everlasting view of that part of the world has always been the greyness of everything and Riga is no exception.    The story is well-reviewed elsewhere, so my thoughts turn to Wallander himself. A bleak man, devastated by the break-up of his marriage and the distancing by his daughter, committed to dogged determination to solve a murder mystery. In this story he has to resort to physical force but, nonetheless, needs to use his brain to work out who are the culprits. That he gets it wrong is no bad thing. Nobody, even in fiction, should be perfect!    He yearns for the solace of a loving partner but life and circumstances move against his rather shy approach to solving this problem. Thanks to the TV shows, I can assume he doesn't progress too far. He also always seems to manage a swipe at the social problems in his native country, something which adds a little flavour to his dour attitude in general!    I'm away to read the next book (and the others) now that I am hooked on another great detective character. I understand the author is considering - or may well have begun - another Wallander book. I hope so.","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

The point his is making is made very well (that success is as much to do with being born in the right place at the right time - it is about riding a wave) and the case put forward is compelling enough.  However, it seems that the book presents the same line of thought through many different examples.  For me, the thinking didn't seem to evolve through the book - once you got the idea, it didn't really evolve.  I was expecting so much more.      I found Part 1 a little bit slow and repetitive, but things definitely picked up in Part 2.

It isn't animator Anita Blake's intention to go there, but she finds herself coerced into being the designated drive for her friend Catherine's bachelorette party and gives in during a weak moment, one exacerbated by lack of sleep. She has already turned down the opportunity to do a job for the local vampires as it is, and she has a feeling this night won't end well.<br /><br />Club owner and master vampire, Jean-Claude, is undeniably sexy, and Anita has to work hard to fight her attraction to him, which he doesn't make easy. Called away from the club on police business, she returns to find things have gone horribly wrong and Catherine is in great danger. Anita finds herself in the uncomfortable position of either agreeing to help the vampires or risk her friend's life.<br /><br />Master vampire Nikolaos looks like a delicate young girl, but she's anything but that. She wants to know who's been killing vampires in St. Louis. Anita reluctantly takes the job. As if things aren't bad enough, fellow exorcist, Edward, demands Anita tell him where Nikoloaos' day-time resting place is. He gives her twenty-four hours to tell him, or else....<br /><br />This is the first novel in the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series, written by fellow St. Louisan Laurell K. Hamilton. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pleased with what I got. Anita Blake is a spunky character. The novel is told in her voice. She's an animator by trade, which basically means she raises the dead, for a company called Animators, Inc. She also helps the police with investigations regarding the supernatural, when they need it. Anita is a tough woman, with a strong faith, and a lot of experience with things that go bump in the night. She's also very resourceful and brave, although there are things she has sense enough to be afraid of.<br /><br />Hamilton creates quite a detailed paranormal alternate universe set in St. Louis, and populates it with some very interesting people. Besides Edward, there is Anita's friend and private detective, Ronnie, and vampire junkie Phillip, just to name a couple. I was particularly fascinated by Jean-Claude and hope to see much more of him in future volumes.<br /><br />This is not a romance novel by any means, nor does it take a romantic view of vampires and the supernatural. There is a gritty realism here. People do get hurt, and blood gets spilled. Look for the scene with the freak party/swingers party--those are some of the creepiest people you'll ever meet.<br /><br />Great first novel. I look forward to reading more about Anita's world and seeing what lies in store for her.","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

Without doubt, this work is one of the best, if not the best, book available on this particular era.     Dr. Critchley, as one of the first, has succeeded in providing his readers with a detailed, highly accurate account of the first years of the Mafia in New York City, with many never before published information, making it a valuable addition to anyone's true crime library.     Starting off with the origins of the criminal societies in both Italy and abroad, Dr. Critchley guides the reader across the first real NYC Mafia organization, the Morello family, the famous Harlem Murder Stable, the Brooklyn Camorra, the notorious Good Killer case, right up to the Castellammarese War, one of the biggest turning point in Italian organized crime.     Never before seen pictures received from relatives of mob figures, several detailed charts and maps, as well as extensive notes add to the value of this work not only for those interested in the Mafia, but also for serious researchers of the subject. Using mainly primary sources, Dr. Critchley's work is a MUST HAVE for anyone who would like to know more about this period in American's criminal history. The relatively high retail price is definitely not unfair; as a frequent reader of Mafia related books, I thought it was worth every penny!","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

This book is sexy as all hell!","Raw tells the story of Chastity Jones, a street-smart 19-year-old young woman from Harlem whose father killed her mother when she was 16. After being sexually assaulted while in foster care (and boy, is the rape told in vivid detail!) she runs away and becomes a stripper in a men's club. It's there that she meets Legend Foster. He's a mysterious and gorgeous man who makes a mint by hosting parties for ballers and athletes in his Harlem brownstone. His parties are so famous, that people are willing to pay hundreds and thousands just to get into the VIP section. And let me tell you, some of the things that goes on in those parties will have you panting, sweating, and embarrassed to keep reading, but unable to stop reading!  Legend takes Chastity under his wing, and teaches her all the tricks to get men to spend big time money on her, and soon she's the toast of the town. But she's also fallen in love with Legend. But while she thinks he MIGHT be interested in her, he never makes a play.   Then she meets his cousin, Hunter. Sparks fly immediately, especially after he takes her shopping at Tiffany's and Winston's, and flies her to places like the Bahamas just to do more shopping.  But when Legend finds out that Chastity and Hunter has become an item he has a fit.   No, this is not like some of the urban erotica books where the main female character is beat up by the man (or men) in her life (come on, what's sexy about that?); I've read way too many of those books, as it is. This is a book about sex, love, lust, and money . . . and a woman who decides she wants it all -- and gets it all. The only question is, can she come out on top.   I cannot believe that this a debut book, and I really found it incredible when I heard that the author was only 21.  Raw is an incredible book. Incredibly written, and and incredibly exciting. And incredibly sexy!   And I'm just hoping there's a Part II!","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

Of the four volumes, in which the poetry is arranged in chronological order, Volume Four has a few unique features.  First, the General Index, at the back of Volume Four, for ALL of the poetry, in all four volumes.  There are actually two alphabetical indices:  one, for the poem titles, and a second index for the first line of each poem.  So this is the feature you need, if you are looking for a particular Mangan poem anywhere within the Collected Works edition.<br />Second, those poems confined to Volume Four are the ones dating from the end of Mangan's all too brief life, including those which were published after he died. Following the Volume Four poetry is an appendix of copious notes supplying information on every last poem, no matter how brief.<br />Mangan is particularly sought out for his passionate and lyrical English versions of the songs and ballads left behind in Gaelic by the bards of Eire/Ireland.  He set everything from histories (the account of all the clans) to Aislings (his version of Roisin Dubh, the well-known &quot;Dark Rosaleen&quot;).<br />&quot;Saint Patrick's Hymn at Tara&quot; is near the beginning of Volume Four.  From this lengthy arrangement of verses, comes that one verse  which has achieved notoriety under the title &quot;St Patrick's Rune.&quot;  Those of you who have read Madeleine L'Engle's fictional book, &quot;A Swiftly Tilting Planet,&quot;  and who recall that each chapter in the book is headed with one line from &quot;St Patrick's Rune,&quot;  take a long hard look at &quot;Saint Patrick's Hymn at Tara.&quot;  Here you will find the exact same wording of that invocation, for Mrs. L'Engle took the &quot;rune&quot; directly from James Clarence Mangan's English translation, without giving the credit to the translator, right down to the verse's final line, &quot;between myself and the powers of darkness.&quot;","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

We already know that King can do amazing things with the novella and short story formats, and here he delivers his usual stylish writing. If you are willing to accept terror rather than horror as the genre, then [[ASIN:0743571185 The Gingerbread Girl]] will keep you absorbed for its two-hour running time.<br /><br />The title character, Emily, runs to get away from the pain of a dead baby and a failing marriage. She leaves her home with nothing but a credit card and the clothes she has on. Taking refuge in her father's beach house in the Florida Keys, she runs in the off-season solitude. One day she finds a house occupied, sees a dead girl in the trunk of a car - and is abducted by a mad serial killer. Em winds up running for her life.<br /><br />Em, the killer, and the steamy beauty of the island are the main elements in this tale. The plot may not be full of surprises but it parlays a somewhat predictable story into two hours of tension. Neither Em nor the knife-wielding stalker are as fully developed as a novel would permit, but when Stephen King's in charge, you know you're in for some good stuff. Like the gingerbread man who jumped off the pan and ran out the door, Em is running to save her life. Will she meet the same tragic end as the gingerbread man? You'll have to listen for yourself to find out.<br /><br />[ETA: I've been advised that this novella IS available in print, in the anthology JUST AFTER SUNSET, first published by Scribner in December 2008 and reprinted by Pocket in September 2009.

Every conceivable aspect about moving vehicles and moving-vehicles on the road seems to be covered, from ABS systems, altered traffic patterns, passing 18-wheelers, photo-stops, side-view mirrors, driver attention, tolerating SUVs, congestion, re-timing traffic signals, DUI, media traffic reports, bicyclists, lane markings. Anything else? Plenty.<br /><br />If you're not already anxious, as driver (or as pedestrian), about what can, does, will, might go wrong while at the wheel, this is the definitive eye-opener. We find out being in traffic is a lot more dynamic and complex an activity then we'd imagine; indeed, with the worrisome case this book makes about traffic, it's surprising we actually get to where we're going more often than not.<br /><br />Actually, the author rarely gives us the \\""why\\"" on we drive the way we do...but he goes off the deep end with the \\""how.\\"" Without many conclusions or much depth, Vanderbilt offers a complex mix of facts, hypotheses, anecdotes, premises, statistics -hundreds of them, all describing today's kind of \\""traffic.\\"" He's thorough, no question. Check the more than 100 pages (!) of footnotes, acknowledgements and index in the back of this information-packed edition...which could probably be a great reference book in itself. As such, the reading sometimes gets a little too \\""inside\\"" and technical.<br /><br />Too, \\""Traffic\\"" has few solutions. \\""Here's an idea that didn't work...,\\"" the author might detail; but here's something that was once successfully addressed...in Belgium, he also might tell us. Matter of fact, Vanderbilt spends countless dreary pages on traffic and drivers in far-off places...like Delhi, Israel, Rome, Beijing, Mexico City, Spain, to mention just a few. He might have instead concentrated on the traffic messes we have right here...at Hollywood and Vine, State and Madison, 7th and Broadway (and places in between) instead of going to lands we never turned left in. Matter of fact, he could have completely dumped the mostly humdrum chapter on \\""How Traffic Explains the World.\\"" An Australian study says that \\""black cars crash more times than white cars.\\"" Really??<br /><br />The author often points to road congestion, fatalities, crashes, lane queues, rage as mostly \\""driver fault\\""...but curiously gives a complete pass to town/city administrators, traffic engineers, and street-side enforcement whose charge it is to \\""keep traffic moving.\\"" Whatever cities do to alleviate their traffic jams, apparently, is always/was always just right. [Oh? Then why do we still have to contend with all the daily traffic snags? -Ah, it's we drivers.] A common use of \\""stop signs\\"" as traffic control, actually on the books as forbidden in many states, is ignored. What about traffic citations; how effective are they? Are there fewer being issued? Vanderbilt doesn't say. What about all the right-turn-after-stop violations we do? Why is this allowed to go on, Tom? -And town fathers of all stripes have big plans for future hi-tek traffic management, but what about...right now? Vanderbilt stays away from analysis along all these lines....<br /><br />Further, the book mostly steers clear of the common \\""me first\\"" attitude people sport when driving. It's the old \\""I'll drive the way I want to drive\\"" road mentality. Indeed, what of drivers who do \\""California rolls,\\"" ignore red lights and speed limits, pass on the right, tailgate and cut-off cyclists...with impunity? Notably, Vanderbilt says drivers do do all this but pretty much skips how we might effectively reduce the number of infractions. -Is it because \\""fewer\\"" traffic tickets are in fact being written, encouraging masses of drivers to take chances while at the wheel? A closer look's not in this book....<br /><br />Vanderbilt frequently uses a sobering data-base-like style. To be sure, there are enough particulars for the book to be a footnote in someone else's...such as: \\""...according to estimates, men die at a rate of 7.3 deaths per million miles; for women the rate is 1.3.

It tugs at heart strings. It hollows out the chest, and leaves an empty feeling behind. All I wanted to do throughout the entire book was save Nikki. If you are sensitive to abuse, especially child abuse and sexual abuse, please be aware this book does contain moments of all of the above.<br /><br />Nikki, a fourteen year old living in the ghetto in St. Louis, is looking for a reason in life. Her mama is an alcoholic who is never home. She has been uprooted from a nice life in Washington, to living with her grandma, Aunt TeeTee who is a crackhead, Uncle Lee, who is a jerk, which you will see when you read, and cousins. Of the cousins, Meechie is her best friend. Together, both are in need of a stable home life and parents who care.<br /><br />Nikki's mama, Clarene, never gives Nikki, nor anyone else, answers. She constantly tells everyone to stay out of her business. And to Nikki, it is not only to stay out of her business, but to not ask her any questions. Clarene has a difficult time staying in relationships, and at the end of each one, blames Nikki for it failing. At times it is only in words and threats, other times it is with her hand.<br /><br />All Nikki wants is her mother's love, her mother to care, to stay home, to show her daughter the attention she craves, but whole heartedly deserves. But, unfortunately, the quest to that goal is not an easy one. If she even meets the goal.<br /><br />Throughout the story, Grandma is Nikki's guiding light. She is the mother figure most of the time. Grandma asks Nikki to be patient, to allow her mama time to figure things out. Nikki has a hard time understanding this. But she desperately tries to be strong, hiding all the hurt, fighting back all the tears.<br /><br />From one failed relationship to the next, Nikki is moved around frequently with her mama, only to have the heartache hit even more. Then Nikki's sister, Sissy, comes for a visit, and Nikki has high hopes of things being better. Does heartache strike again? You betcha.<br /><br />Sissy then sees the life Nikki has been living, and wants to go back home to her dad. Nikki pleads to go with her. But that pleading doesn't come easy, nor does the result of being caught in planning her way out.<br /><br />From her mama, to Grandma's secrets, to Meechie not understanding, though understanding all too well at the same time, to the nightmare worst night of Nikki's life right as she was thinking she had found her freedom - Nikki's life is a disaster, but never by her own actions. In the end when Mama promises Nikki the world, swears at being clean and finding Jesus, but can Nikki trust her? Or can she continue living in the party-type-house she has been in? Little Miss nobody needs to become Little Miss Somebody, to someone.<br /><br />I needed to take Nikki in my arms and hug her and love her and show her how a mother truly loves and cares so many times, I lost count. It's so heartbreaking to read her story, especially knowing it was based on a true story. My heart goes out to Nikki!<br /><br />**I received an ARC of Little Miss Somebody to read for an honest, unbiased review**","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

Since opening this space in early 2006 I have paid individual honor to all three in successive years. In that same spirit for this year's, and for future January observances,  I will highlight some other lesser figures of the revolutionary pantheon or those who contributed in some way to the development of this movement, mainly American at first as befits the title of this blog but eventually others in the international movement as well. This year's first honoree was the Trotskyist founder and organization leader James P. Cannon. Cannon represented that first American generation who formed the core of cadre directly influenced to the left by the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. Here I take a step back to the pre-World War I period and honor probably the most well-known socialist of that period, Eugene V. Debs.     For many reasons, the most important of which for our purposes here are the question of the nature o the revolutionary party and of revolutionary leadership, the Russian Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 was a turning point in the international labor movement. In its aftermath, there was a definitive and I would argue, necessary split, between those leftists (and here I use that term generically to mean socialists, communists, anarchists, syndicalists and the like) who sought to reform the capitalist state from within and those who saw that it needed to be destroyed `root and branch' and new institutions established to create a more just society. This division today continues, in truncated form to be sure, to define the contours of the question. The heroic American pre- World War II socialist labor leader and icon, Eugene V. Debs, as is very well described in this little book, contained within his personal political trajectory allthe contradictions of that split. As will be described below in more detail we honor Debs for his generosity of socialist spirit while at the same time underscoring that his profile is, in the final analysis, not that of something who could have led a proletarian revolution in the earlier part of the 20th century.    Professor Currie here has done the very valuable service of outlining the highlights of Debs' political career and of his inner ideological turmoil for those who need a short course on what set Debs, above all others except, perhaps, \\""Big Bill\\"" Haywood in the pre-World War I movement. The professor makes clear that his is a political profile and not the extensive detailed informational one of traditional biography. For that, if one is so inclined in that direction after reading this primer, then it is still necessary to go Ray Ginger's \\""The Bending Cross: A Biography of Eugene V. Debs\\"". I will review that effort in this space at a later time. For now though let me give the highlights I found that every serious labor militant or every serious student of socialism needs to think through.     If history has told us anything over the past one hundred and fifty years plus of the organized labor movement it is that mere trade union consciousness under conditions of capitalist domination, while commendable and necessary, is merely the beginning of wisdom. By now several generations of labor militants have passed through the school of trade unionism with varying results; although precious few have gone beyond that to the class consciousness necessary to \\""turn the world upside down\\"" to use an old expression from the 17th century English Revolution. In the late 19th when American capitalism was consolidating itself moving onto its industrial phases the landscape was filled with pitched class battles between labor and capital.     One of those key battles in the 1890's was led by one Eugene V. Debs and his American Railway Union against the mammoth rail giant, ThePullman Company. At that time the rails were the key mode of transportation in the bustling new industrial capitalist commerce. At that time, by his own reckoning, Debs saw the struggle from a merely trade unionist point of view, that is a specific localized economic struggle for better wages and conditions rather than taking on the capitalist system and its state. That strike was defeated and as a result Debs and others became \\""guests' of that state in a local jail in Illinois for six months or so. The key conclusion drawn from this `lesson', for our purposes, was that Debs personally finally realized that the close connection between the capitalists and THEIR state (troops, media, jails, courts) was organic and needed to be addressed.     Development of working class political class consciousness comes in many ways; I know that from my own personal experiences running up against the capitalist state. For Debs this \\""up close and personal\\"" confrontation with the capitalist drove him, reluctantly at first and with some reservations, to see the need for socialist solutions to the plight of the workingman (and women). Professor Currie details this transformation very nicely, including the seemingly inevitable thrashing about that every political person does when a politically transformative experience occurs. In Debs' case this involved an early infatuation with the ideas of cooperative commonwealths then popular among radicals as a way to basically provide a parallel alternative society away from capitalism.     Well again, having gone thorough that same kind of process of conversion myself (in my case 'autonomous' urban communes, you know, the `hippie' experience of the late 1960's and early 1970's); Debs fairly quickly came to realize that an organized political response was necessary and he linked up his efforts with the emerging American Socialist Party.  Before World War I the major political model for politically organizing the working class was provided by theMarxist-dominated German Social Democratic Party. At that time, and in this period of pre-imperialist capitalist development, this was unquestionably the model to be followed. By way of explanation the key organizing principle of that organization, besides providing party discipline for united action, was to create a \\""big tent\\"" party for the social transformation of society. Under that rubric the notion was to organize anyone and everyone, from socialist-feminists, socialist vegetarians, pacifists, municipal reformers, incipient trade union bureaucrats, hard core reformists, evolutionary socialists and- revolutionaries like Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg who we honor to this day. The American Social Party that Debs joined exhibited all those tendencies (and some even more outlandish) of the German model. And as long as no great events acted to disrupt the \\""unity\\"" of this amorphous formation the various tensions within the organization concerning reform or revolution were subdued for a time. Not forever though.      Various revolutionary tendencies within the workers' movement have historically had opposing positions concerning parliamentary politics: what to do politically while waiting for the opportune moment to take political power. The controversy centered (and today centers around) whether to run for elective executive and/or legislative offices. Since World War I a very strong argument has developed that revolutionaries should not run for executive offices of the capitalist state on the principle that we do not want to be responsible for the running of the capitalist state. On the other hand running for legislative office under the principle of acting as \\""tribunes of the people\\"" continues to have validity. The case of the German revolutionary social democrat Karl Liebknecht using his legislative office to denounce the German war effort DURING the war is a very high expression of that position. This question, arguably, was a little less clears in the pre-war period.    If Eugene V. Debs is remembered politically today it is probably for his five famous runs for the American presidency (one, in 1920,  run from jail) from 1900 to 1920 (except 1916). Of those the most famous is the 1912 four- way fight (Teddy Roosevelt and his \\""Bull Moose\\"" Party providing the fourth) in which he got almost a million votes and something like 5 percent of the vote- this is the high water mark of socialist electoral politics then and now. Professor Currie goes into some detail here about the demands on these campaigns personally on the aging Debs and of the internal political oppositions to his candidacies.     I would only mention that a strong argument could be made here for support of the idea of a revolutionary (and, at least until the early 1920's Debs considered himself, subjectively, a revolutionary) running for executive office- the presidency- without violating political principle (of course, with the always present proviso that if elected he would refuse to serve). Certainly the issues to be fought around- the emerging American imperial presence in the world, the fierce wage struggles, the capitalist trustification and cartelization of industry, the complicity of the courts, the struggle for women's right to vote, the struggle against the emerging anti- black Jim Crow regime in the South would make such a platform a useful propaganda tool. Especially, as the good professor as noted, since Debs was one of the premier socialist orators of the day, if perhaps too flowery and long-winded for today's eye or ear.            As the American Socialist party developed in the early 20th century, and grew by leaps and bounds in this period, a somewhat parallel development was occurring somewhat outside this basically parliamentary movement. In 1905, led by the revolutionary militant \\""Big Bill\\"" Haywood and with an enthusiastic (then) Debs present probably the most famous mass militant labor organization in American history was formed, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW, Wobblies). As it name denotes this organization stood as, in effect, the nucleus of the industrial unionism that would win the day among the unorganized in  the 1930's with the efforts of the CIO. But it also was, as James P. Cannon an early IWW organizer noted in one of his books, the nucleus of a revolutionary political party. One of the reasons, among others, for its demise was that it never was able to resolve that contradiction between party and union. But that is an analysis for another day.     What is important to note here is that organization form fit in, very nicely indeed, with Debs' notions of organizing the unorganized, the need for industrial unionization (as opposed to the prevailing narrow craft orientation of the Samuel Gompers-led AFL). Nevertheless Debs, to his credit, was no \\""dual unionist\\"", that is, committed to ignoring or going around the AFL and establishing \\""revolutionary\\"" unions. This question of \\""boring from within\\"" organized labor or \\""dual unions\\"" continues to this day, and historically has been a very thorny question among militants faced with the bureaucratic inertia of the trade union bureaucracy. Debs came down on the side of the angels on this one (even if he later took unfavorable positions on IWW actions).              Although Debs is probably best known for his presidential runs (including that one from Atlanta prison in 1920 that I always enjoy seeing pictures of the one where he converses with his campaign staff in his cell) he really should be, if he is remembered for only one thing, remembered for his principled opposition to American war preparedness and eventual entry into World War I in 1917. Although it is unclear in my mind how much of Debs' position stemmed from personal pacifism, how much from Hoosier isolationism (after all he was the quintessential Midwestern labor politician, having been raised and lived all his life in Indiana) and how much was an anti-imperialist statement he nevertheless, of all major socialist spokesmen to speak nothing of major politicians in general , was virtually alone in his opposition when Woodrow Wilson pulled the hammer down and entered American forces into the European conflict.     That, my friends, should command respect from almost everyone, political friend or foe alike. Needless to say for his opposition he was eventually tried and convicted of, of all things, the catch-all charge of sedition and conspiracy. Some things never change. Moreover, that prison term is why Debs had to run from prison in 1920. Professor Currie does a good job here giving the narrative of the basis of his conviction, the tenor of the times, the appeals process and his eventual release by President Harding.       I started out this exposition of Debs' political trajectory under the sign of the Russian Revolution and here I come full circle. I have, I believe, highlighted the points that we honor Debs for and now to balance the wheel we need to discuss his shortcomings (which are also a reflection of the shortcomings of the internationalist socialist movement then, and now). The almost universal betrayal of its anti- war positions of the pre-war international social democracy, as organized in the Second International and led by the German Party, by its subordination to the war aims of its respective individual capitalist governments exposed a deep crevice in the theory and practice of the movement.    As the experiences of the Russian revolution pointed out it was no longer possible for reformists and revolutionaries to coexist in the same party. Literally, on more than one occasion, these formally connected tendencies were on opposite sides of the barricades when the social tensions of society exploded. It was not a pretty sight and called for a splitting and realignment of the revolutionary forces internationally. The organizational expression of this was the formation, in the aftermath of the Russian revolution, of the CommunistInternational in 1919. Part of that process, in America, included a left-wing split (or purge depending on the source read) and the creation, at first, of two communist organizations. As the most authoritative left-wing socialist of the day one would have thought that Debs would have inclined to the communists. That was not to be the case as he stayed with the remnant of the American Socialist Party until his death in the late 1920's.     No one would argue that the early communist movement in America was not filled with more than its share of political mistakes, esoterica and just plain weirdness but that is where the revolutionaries were in the 1920's.  And this brings us really to Debs' ultimate problem as a socialist leader and why I made that statement above that he could not lead a proletarian revolution in America, assuming that he was his desire. Professor Currie, and not he alone among academic students of Debs, has pointed out that Debs had a life long aversion to political faction and in-fighting. I would agree, as any rational radical politician would, that faction and in-fighting are not virtuous in and of themselves and are a net drain on the tasks of propaganda, recruitment and united front actions that should drive left-wing political work. However, as critical turning points in the international socialism movement have shown sometimes the tensions between the political appetites of supposed like-minded individuals cannot be contained in one organization. This question is most dramatically posed, of course, in a revolutionary period when the tensions are whittled down to choices for or against the revolution. One side of the barricade or the other.    That said, Debs' personality, demeanor and ultimately his political program of trying to keep \\""big tent\\"" socialist together tarnished his image as a socialist leader. Professor Currie also has several sections at the end of his book on Debs' positions on convicts, women, and blacks, education, religionand government. Debs was no theorist, socialist or otherwise, and many of his positions would not pass muster among radicals today. I note his economic determinism argument that the black question is subsumed in the class question.  I have discussed this question elsewhere and will not address it here. I would only note, for a socialist, his position is just flat out wrong. I also note that, outside his support for women's suffrage and working women's rights to equal page his attitude toward women was strictly Victorian. As was his wishy-washy attitude toward religion. That said, Eugene V. Debs, warts and all, gets a fair exposition here. And should get a fair nod from history as the premier American socialist of the pre-World War I period.","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

I used the book to study for the PMP exam as my main study source together with Rita's PMP Exam Prep book.    The intent of the book is great. The concepts in the book are sound and undoubtedly useful, after you decipher them :), but the writing is just so poor and so unnecessarily complicated, that makes the reading a real pain. I guess it is what you typically get when books are written by committees. There is a lot of duplication, and also many mistakes... way too many.    Regardless, if you really want to truly understand PMI's take on PM you need to read and understand the book. Just keep in mind that it is a model after all for project management and that in reality each situation requires proper judgement of what should be used out if it, at what extent, and so forth.    In the end, the content of the book did help me learn a lot, pass the exam and become a much better project manager. No question about this.    A final note, keep in mind that the book does not contain all the aspects that one needs to know for passing the PMP exam. It does not claim that it does though either; just be aware of that. My take would be use this book with another exam preparation guide that will fill that gap. It will also make your life easier from a point of view of \\""digesting\\"" the concepts. I used Rita's Exam Prep book and it did the job for me.","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

He is taught sign language. Some signs were made up when nothing close to the description was found. Edgar, his father Gar and Trudy, his mother carry on as if nothing is wrong. They raise dogs in a remote Wisconsin dell. The story starts getting interesting, but boy, the wait!   But the characters, even Edgar at times, are so blah. Why should anyone be interested in him, or what he thinks or does? For those dog lovers, the training descriptions might click. They will be new to most readers and therefore will hold their attention.   The story starts building up more than half way through with introduction of Claude, Gar's brother, and then Gar's death.  Somehow the Hamlet theme, (conjured up by Stephen King?) is not quite apt.  O.K. Claude=Claudius; Trudy=Gertrude, Papideau=Polonius? Jealousy in the mind of an adolescence (the original tale on which Hamlet is based on is about a young boy, Shakespeare speeded up action by a fully adult Hamlet who didn't have to grow up to seek revenge. But revenge is far from Edgar's mind when he wanders all over Wisconsin finding a way to Canada. The scene with the three yearlings are good but still something is missing. The storm at the Canadian Lake also leaves the reader wandering at the story teller's capabilities.  O.K. These are not positive which does not mean that the book has not an animal magnetism to it which compels one to read, hoping for better cohesion. If one reads Jack London (Call of the Wild, White Fang, one finishes with the sense of experienced something profound and beautiful. Mr.Wroblewski is a significant plotter and plodder and in time will get enough inspiration to make a book like this a noble experience.  Right now, it is something unique, a long tale of a boy and dogs. All the implied metaphors are just that. It is no Hamlet, Mr. Critic. I don't think that it was meant to be. Or, if it were, that's what is wrong about the book. Just a little judicial pruning, it could have been a great tale. Why is a cigar not just that? And The Story of Edgar Sawtelle, a book about dog breeding and a little boy in the background of a Wisconsin wilderness.  I missed Henry, the only enigmatic character that stands out. Even he fades quickly out of mind, when one closes the book. Yet this is unusual and different. Most readers want that. Strange to say after writing this review, that I conclude by saying I'm looking forward to his next novel.","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

He also goes into great detail about the science behind the principles in his book using real world examples that anyone can relate to instead of hiding behind lots of scientific jargon that most coaches use to boost their ego and internet status.  There are LOTS of books on strength training that simply repeat the same ideas and principles over and over again, basically the industry is full of repeated ideas and concepts that are often dressed up and disguised to be unique to the author.  With this book Chad truly breaks new ground and discusses methods seldom written or talked about yet crucial to building an athletic, muscular, lean, and sculpted body in the fastest time possible; truly groundbreaking information that will give every reader cause to re-evaluate their own programs if they are truly serious about their training.  This book is very unique in that you can start reading and training with the workouts included in the very same day. Chad explains the basic premise in very simple fashion for the readers that want the buts and bolts approach so they can start right away yet there is also lots physiology related information for the true science geeks like myself that want to devote more time to the true understanding of the Huge in a Hurry system.  Another unique feature of this book is the mobility and flexibility chapter. This is a widely overlooked subject in many books and Chad addresses it in detail with sample drills and a mobility program that is essential for appropriate movement and correct muscle activation, which all lead to recruiting more muscle fibers that translate into a bigger and stronger you.  No stone is left unturned as nutrition, supplementation, and recovery are addressed in detail.  This book is truly  a steal at under $20 as coach Waterbury is  world renowned and  surely people have paid thousands of dollars for only a fraction of the information in this book, if you don't pick up a copy of this you are not a serious strength athlete and are wasting your time in the gym, GO GET IT!","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

This is one of the many hilarious and thoroughly convincing injunctions in To Rise Again at a Decent Hour, a novel I thoroughly enjoyed and admire.  The story of Paul O'Rourke, dentist and obsessive failed romantic, desperately seeing a sense of identity and belonging is both hilarious and heartbreaking.  Paul is an exaggeration or the personification of our 21st century alienation from each other into &#34;virtual&#34; relationships.  He is flummoxed and frustrated by the rules of the game (finding happiness, someone, a permanent place) which always seem just out of reach.<br /><br />Ferris has the courage to make big and bold observations--doubt may not only be more intelligent than faith, it may also be more comforting.  Embracing a tradition of suffering (whether you're a Red Sox Fan or a Jew) is not noble but masochistic.  The former are encouraged to savor victory, the latter life. All are encouraged to doubt.  I am not a bit surprised that To Rise Again is disliked by so many.  While very funny and accessibly written,  tackling big moral questions about the meaning of life or what to do with it  may be off-putting to some. Asking readers to embrace yet another deracinated anti-hero into the literary pantheon is not everyone's idea of a great read.  It is mine though.<br /><br />I was often dazzled by Ferris' ability to balance the big and the small, the micro and the macro.  The author traverses in and out of biblical myth and modern history and religion, sports, pop culture and quite impressively dental and oral hygiene.  It's hard to make use of baseball as a metaphor without seeming hackneyed but Ferris makes it feel authentic and fresh.  The book is not a perfect one.  I found some parts implausible, parts of the section about the Ulm too long or disjointed.  These though are small complaints.  To Rise Again at a Decent Hour does what great novels do best.  It entertains and it hold a mirror to humans that shows us in a paradoxical light that is both more and less flattering.  To Rise Again is a terrific book.to humans that shows us in a paradoxical light that is both more and less flattering.  To Rise Again is a terrific book.","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

After I posted my review of [[ASIN:0940322730 Exploits and Adventures of Brigadier Gerard (New York Review Books Classics)]], a fellow Amazonian urged me and other fans of that fictional Napoleonic hussar to read The Exploits of Baron de Marbot. I can only say, `Thank you'.<br /><br />Marbot was the son of another Napoleonic general and The Exploits of Baron de Marbot details his rise from enlistment in the ranks up to general of the Hussars. Marbot writes clearly and concisely without flowery affectations, arcane discourses on military strategy, or lengthy self-justifcations. And what tales he has to tell! Marbot fought with Napoleon's armies across Europe from Italy and Austria to the Peninsular War and finally Waterloo. Marbot accomplished remarkable feats of skill and bravery. He suffered numerous injuries along the way. At one point, he awoke from an injury to find himself stripped of clothing and, being taken for dead, dragged toward an anonymous burial.

Often, the teacher in question is male, but in Barry Lyga's BOY TOY, the offender is a young female history teacher who targets and seduces her 12-year-old student, Josh.  Told through a series of  scenes from Josh's high school life, years later, mixed with flashbacks, this is a compelling but disturbing first person view of the impact that sexual abuse and betrayed trust has on a young person.    The teen voice is authentic and believable, and the situations described in the book are graphic, though not gratuitously so. Lyga does a phenomenal job making sense of a situation that didn't make sense to 12-year-old Josh - a situation that left him struggling with psychological baggage as an older teen. Part of that masterful writing includes vivid descriptions of the sex scenes and the powerful emotional and physical responses they evoked in the young protagonist. As a result of that and the mature topic in general, this is definitely a book for older high school students.  Please don't give it to younger readers and then complain that it's inappropriate.  It's a frank, realistic look at something that happens in our society all too often and has a profound effect on kids.","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

He stated that he was going to write a book about Spanish-speaking gay autobiographies, but he learned that Latin American works always brought up issues of race in ways that Spanish counterparts did not.  I didn't read Professor Gutmann's book about masculinity in Mexico City, but I imagine that this book may be its diametrical opposite in that Oaxaca is presented as rural and having a large indigenous population.    Professor Gutmann is very interested in the superstructure.  Whereas other academics or laypeople would point to culture as the reason for most phenomena, this author points to governmental rules, global companies' profits, economies, and international migration as the cause of many items.  For example, he stated that Chinese men don't choose to use condoms for fun; their government's one-child policy forces them to use protection.  With regard to Mexico, he notes that the Mexican government is complicit with global pill companies in not bringing the price of HIV meds down.  He states that if family planning clinics only focus on women, then few men will know they have the option of getting a vasectomy.  In the book, one chapter tends to speak about these superstructural matters and the following chapter would speak about the author's everyday conversations with Oaxacans.  For readers that don't care for academic-speak, they can easily skip over the more complicated chapters.    The penultimate chapter on indigenous healing is a bit extraneous.  He begins by saying curanderos often don't employ rigid dichotomies between the sexes.  The chapter only marginally speaks of men's sexual choices.  It's kinda just a way to lengthen the book.    Dr. Gutmann becomes upset when any Mexican says, \\""Mexican men get HIV because they are so horny, that they'll even sleep with men.\\""  Logically, he points out to such speakers that when he asks of any man who has kicked it with men they say no.  A huge purpose in this book is for him to detail other ways that Oaxacan men catch HIV.  However, by finding the exceptions, he may be hiding the rule in a dangerous way.  There is a book about gays and HIV in the Yucatan and the American professor there detailed the many ways that HIV-positive Mexican men do everything possible to not reveal same-sex action.  Gutmann himself interviews many Mexican men that admit that they have had sex with gay men or prostituted themselves with men.  One thing I do love is that he describes a \\""mix'e\\"" who seems like a Mexican two-spirit person.  I once read in a book on Aztecs in a small footnote that they probably had third-gender men like US Native American tribes had.  Perhaps this book should be read in conjunction with other books on indigenous homosexuality in the Americas.    Gutman is a progressive with a wife and two daughters.  He may not be knowledgeable of the huge numbers of communities and nations of color that dismiss gayness as \\""a white scourge\\"" or \\""unknown to us before colonialism,\\"" etc.  Several African, African-American, South Asian gay activists have tried to challenge that fallacy.  So, in this light, it is amazing that heterosexual Oaxacans can admit that same-sex liaisons happen.  They never blame US Americans or Europeans for \\""forcing\\"" Mexican men to get busy in that way.  The way that these Oaxacans challenge gay invisibility in this non-white context is amazing and wonderful, yet Dr. Gutmann gives a positive review of that phenomenon.  I may not have articulated this well, but I find it troubling that Dr. Gutmann did not take this into acount.    As far as I know, Professor Gutmann was not teaching at Brown when I was an undergraduate there.  Still, countless students speak about how they wish more classes would bring issues of race, gender, sexuality, national identity, and justice matters together.  Well, Gutmann accomplishes that in this book and something tells me his classes would be awesome to take.  I imagine that books like this one could be useful to not only anthro majors, but also gender studies majors.  This is especially true as gender studies departments try to discuss men's issues, and not just women's issues.  Really, his presence and writing may be just another countless reason for students to apply to and matriculate to this awesome university.","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

If you are looking for a broader view of financial history, however, this is not it.  It's very Goldman focused (and I found a bit slow at the start), and delves more in depth on the trading side that came to dominate in the 90s, which I would guess is because that is where the author came from.  It does do a good job of explaining the tension between bankers and traders, but it doesn't have the sheer balance between deifying its subject and history like The House of Morgan or the entertainment value of Liar's Poker.  As a result, if I didn't have much background in financial markets, I would find it harder to read as the book would seem to jump around (and need more context than it gives).    Unlike Morgan, Goldman wasn't as dominant as it is today until more recent history (the 80s), so I found it wasn't as interesting to learn about Goldman's past in such detail, I would have rather seen a more personal account in the boom years, or a more financial markets history focus at the beginning to balance out the fact Goldman wasn't always the leader.  As the book moves on to the 90s, however, I think she does do a great job of explaining the lessons learned at Goldman in the early 90s around risk management, which you see in it's (at least relative) financial discipline as compared to its peers.  The seeds planted by the capital crisis in 1994 at Goldman definitely did reap rewards as Goldman built a much stronger set of risk management controls than its peers, allowing it to better navigate the sub-prime crisis it arguably helped create.  Unfortunately I felt therewere still gaps in the Goldman corporate strategy in the book, as some of analysis around senior staff and their actions appeared to be more hearsay-type information or speculation.  It would have been great to have more C-level accounts of how Goldman worked, although it is well known that Goldman is notoriously clandestine about its inner workings.","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

Putting these two together just seems like common (good marketing) sense.  What makes this such a thrill for horror readers is that we have two utterly divergent authors.  One works in almost a completely faith based, spiritual arena of horror; the other, writes visceral horror of a physical and sexual nature.  Not to say that either hasn't transgressed from time to time to the other's territory, but for the most part, these two writers couldn't be more different from one another in style and aesthetic.  ORGY OF SOULS finds them melding their worlds into one nearly seamless tale of two brothers.  Samuel, an AIDS riddled priest, is having a crisis of faith as his death approaches.  The other, Samson, is a jetsetting model playboy who lives for the earthly delights of the flesh.  But when he discovers his brother is dying, he decides to buy souls from the living to extend his brother's life.  Of course, things aren't quite so simple when Samson's told by a demon that it's a `twenty for one' deal and the souls have to be taken from the living in a violent manner to count towards the deal.  Samson soon finds that he likes killing, especially people that make him angry.  Soon, it's a bloodbath of a novel, leavened by scenes of Samuel trying to save his brother from eternal damnation, while coming to grips with his own inevitable end.  It's pretty easy to tell which character goes with which writer, but in their collaborative strength they manage to transcend the expected, and deliver a tale rife with violence and love.  By story's end, it feels as if one hand is writing with two minds.  I enjoyed ORGY OF SOULS, but like many joint fans of White and Broaddus, I think it would be great to see these two power houses take on their respective spiritual and moral stances and really go for the throat in another book.      --Nickolas Cook","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

The awkward trio spends a lot of time in book three negotiating a working relationship.<br /><br />Eclipse offers a more interesting plot and a faster read than New Moon, the second book in Meyer's series, which was rather slow going. The only slow segment in Eclipse is yet another foray into Quileute legend: as usual, Meyer provides necessary background information in these reports of old Indian lore, but it's relatively dull stuff. Bella here is more like the confident heroine she was in book one than the depressed and whining victim of book two, though she does do some groveling that could give hormonally-challenged teenaged girls a bad name. She also comes to a decision about one of the men in her life that is too sudden to be quite credible, and that arguably is out of keeping with the thrust of that relationship up to that point.<br /><br />Throughout, as I've come to expect from the author, Meyer's prose remains eminently readable. I'm looking forward to the final installment in the series.<br /><br />-- Debra Hamel","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

The prose flows very well - generally, it is a mellow narrative, although there are plenty of instances of the wicked humor and sarcasms left over from his TROPICS days. As Miller settles into his mid-life, hermetic lifestyle in this coastal paradise, it seems that his roamin' days are pretty much over. Yet, his notoriety soon catches up with him, with so many unannounced vistors seeking out the famous author of his once-banned books.<br /><br />This is an entertaining book, a mulligan stew of philosophical musings on art and living; of sketches of Miller's neighbors and wayfarers just passing through; of vignettes of the natural history of Big Sur and its pioneers; and, finally, of details of his very palpable everyday life with friends and family. It is Miller's insatiable love of life that pulls the reader into his portrait of this unique spot, the one he is immersed in as his home.<br /><br />The writing itself is some of Miller's most evocative I think; and yes, it rambles and strays a bit. But this is what makes for such an engaging read. These narrations are from a Henry Miller still searching for meanings to the Big Questions; yet now, the ramblings are being done through the immensity of Big Sur's grandeur instead of the streets and cafes of Paris and New York. It is here that Miller feels he can flourish as a writer, with a fresh freedom and outlook as he stares out at the vast western horizon each day.<br /><br />Hieronymus Bosch used oranges and other fruit in his painting to symbolize the delights of Paradise; Henry Miller has used his words as symbols to reveal to us what he has found in this enduring version of paradise.

Other books I've read about studying make suggestions and give lots of advice but they don't explain clearly how this advice can be incorporated into your time. But this book says: 'do this on weekdays...' and 'do this on the weekend...' - Simple. I don't want to have to read a study skills book and then have to work out my own system, just tell me what to do and I'll do it!<br /><br />At the end of the book he says 'Think of a specific topic that is covered in one of your college courses. If you follow all of the advice that I have given to you in this book then you will encounter this topic again and again and again...' then he lists all of the times you will have gone over this topic if you follow the advice in the book.  He then compares this with the number of times a student with a poor approach would come across the topic (maybe just once, when he/she heard it for the first time in class).  I liked this part because not only does he tell you how to get studying right, he explains how his advice is working.<br /><br />I would recommend reading this book just before you start a new school year or semester, and put the advice into practice from the beginning.<br /><br />A minor criticism I would have is that there isn't much mention of the use of computers or the internet and how to make best use of these type of resources.","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

The essays are interesting, and the writers include  some of the most respected of Evangelical scholars, including Craig Blomberg, Darrell Bock, and Scot McKnight.       And what a knotty problem the synoptic problem is!  Osborne speculates gloomily \\""It is likely the problem will never be solved\\"" (p 137).       There certainly seems no agreement among the scholars as to who wrote the first gospel.   They did seem to agree on a few things, however. First, there seems a general recognition that scholarship has veered off course in a number of  ways.   For the last fifty years, there has likely been too much reliance on the concept of Q, to the point that the Jesus Seminar authors have lately 'quoted' from Q.   Speculation has piled on speculation and \\""the study of Q has crossed into historical revisionism and distortion\\"" (p 58).      Two  other errors have been the modern desire for an inoffensive Jesus, and a belief that there was ever an early Christian community  that was \\""nonmessianic and noneschatological...(since why would) the later messianic and eschatological use so many texts\\"" (p 59) from a group they disagreed with?     Anyone who thinks biblical scholarship is dull will find this book an eyeopening experience, with Scott McKnight holding to Mark as being the first gospel written, while Farmer insist \\""Matthew appears to be the earliest gospel (p 100) and the others all over the map.","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

It's \\""A History of Folk Music Festivals in the United States: Feasts of Musical Celebration\\"" by Ron Cohen. I've not read every word - it's been a busy week - but delved into nearly every chapter, enough to give this book a recommendation.<br /><br />It's not a very big paperback - 154 pages including footnotes and index - but then it was written to provide a background more than detailing every folk festival out there. The first 40% covers the earliest small regional \\""festivals\\"" mostly in the South and the National Folklife Festival. This is all \\""Pre-Newport\\"". There's a chapter on the beginning of the \\""Folk Revival\\"" period, when Newport and Berkeley were started, and when the Philly Festival began during the years Newport wasn't continuing in the early 1960s. One of my favorites  - Fox Hollow - gets a few paragraphs. The Clearwater Festival (with it's many names) gets just one paragraph. Cohen used program books and posters to list a sample of the artists performing.<br /><br />Following 16 pages of black & white reproductions of rare Festival posters come the chapter devoted just to Newport (35 pages) and then the \\""others\\"" which survived after 1980 (Philly, Kerrville, and the Smithsonian Folklife Fest.).<br /><br />The index has more listings for Pete Seeger (obviously) and Joan Baez comes in a close second. Critic Robert Shelton, Archivist Alan Lomax and the venerable Editor (and bookseller) Izzy Young have lots of listings too.<br /><br />The book is an easy read - more like a really long article - with LOTS of footnotes.<br /><br />So, I'll certainly recommend the book - not as a reference text, but as good background as to how the festivals began (going back to one in Philly in 1912!).<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\""Anything Phonographic\\""","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

Lovely.  I really enjoyed myself reading it.<br /><br />Rachel is an endearing character who finds herself with her world crashing down around her ears as she discovers her father is still alive and has another family while she and her mother lived from paycheck to paycheck in as respectable a manner as possible.  Rachel goes through varying degrees of feelings spanning love, guilt, vengefulness, and forfeiture.  She wars with herself constantly as she wants to hate her half-siblings but finds that she can’t because they’re merely products of their environment (which isn’t all money and parties).  She wants to hate her father and she does for a while, but after more information surfaces about the whole situation she finds herself waffling on that cause too, and rightly so.  What I liked even more about all this is that the situation isn’t neatly tied up in a pretty bow at the end.  Rachel hasn’t come to terms with her feelings, has just barely accepted everything that’s happened, but the end note is one of growth and progress.  What she does isn’t necessarily a problem-solver, and could actually pose quite a few more problems of its own, but it was the best of the options she had before her and it kind of kills me a little to say that and if you’ve read the book you’ll know what I’m talking about.  It’s a decision that I could kick back my inner feminist a bit (considering the setting and people involved) and take it for what it was meant to be, which is a really solid, positive ending.  I wish there would have been even more independence for Rachel but all things considered it is nice to have someone to lean on.<br /><br />The story itself was gripping and I had a hard time putting it down when I had to.  It didn’t help that the chapters would often end with some kind of exclamation point moment that, in order to find out reactions or what happened, you needed toread the next chapter.  And it wasn’t just a few of them.  It was pretty much all of them.  So much difficulty walking away from the book when I wasn’t finished with it.<br /><br />I liked the world Willig painted, all glitter and glam on the surface but underneath, and what Rachel saw, was the sloshing, the drunkenness, the vulnerabilities hiding behind facades.  Rachel starts off the book thinking money equals having it all but by the end she has a very different opinion of that, watching people like Cece and her step-mother and her half-sister’s fiance and how they maneuver, and react, through life.  She had a very narrow view of this world before going incognito and infiltrating their parties but once she was in she had a hard time maintaining her facade.  Even the most put-together people had dirt under their nails in some fashion, despite all the show they talked and had unappealing leanings and ended up viewing Rachel as Vera as someone beneath them, even with the guise.  It made it all the more real and brought a realistic perspective to a situation that would have otherwise been glamorized.<br /><br />As the story really picked up I found myself rooting for the best possible outcome and, shock to my black heart, a truly happy ending.  I got close.  Like I said before the book had a sense of closure at the end without everything being so final.  There’s a lot of room left there to explore but Rachel reached her objective and she came to terms, in her own way, with how it all ended up.  There were heart-rending moments and points of tears (because I really am a sap) but it was all so satisfying that I had nothing left in me but joy for THE OTHER DAUGHTER.<br /><br />It’s such a good story.  It does the period justice and gave me such wonderful characters that I was ensnared by all of them.  Even Simon, who was so aloof and barbish with his words to the point that he must have been hiding from something.  There were even characters not to like but they were so richly developed that it was hard not to admire, at the very least, their presence.  So I don’t think I have anything bad to say about this book because at this point I’m rambling and fangirling and just read the book, okay?<br /><br />5<br /><br />I received this book fro the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

A young married woman has been poisoned by a box of chocolate that was meant for someone else. Or was it?<br /><br />The seven members each come up with a different motive, different proofs, and a different murderer. Their contrasting theories and supporting proofs are ingenious and utterly convincing. It's amusing to follow the workings of their devious minds -- and their often outraged reactions to each other's conclusions.<br /><br />As a spoof of the arbitrary detection methods by mystery writers, this book is deliciously successful. As a literary tour de force it's impressive. I still prefer a good whodunit with one solution. But this book was fun, and undeniably clever.<br /><br />First published in 1929, The Poisoned Chocolates Case deserves its status as a Golden Age classic.","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

It was recommended to me by a friend who is a Saint, so I think it holds truth for both sides. I was shocked at how little of what I had in my head about Joseph Smith was true, & enthralled with his real life story & the story of his church. I appreciated that Bushman is a Saint but he is also able to explain things very well in an academic, not purely faithful, manner (& he hasn't gotten excommunicated either!). I am ashamed that we as Americans murdered Joseph Smith, man or prophet (or both), & drove the rest of the faithful out of the country (& did you know that when we wanted them back, Utah would only join the union if their women kept -- not gained, but kept -- their vote?). One cannot be interested in American history or the settling of the West without being curious about the LDS Church. No, I'm not pleased that the Church recently voted in measure 8, but after reading this book I can see that the fear & misconceptions that surrounded Joseph in his life are still with us today.

Segal shows how today most people pay the majority of their income on basic necessities such as housing, transportation, healthcare and security. Many can barely afford those.  We have had a government that pays little attention to social services that could reduce the cost of living for all such as public transportation, good public schools, universal healthcare and social security benefits. Segal criticizes modern American culture that emphasizes economic growth at the expense of real indicators of well-being, such as health, social relationships, leisure time and equity.  Instead we have a proliferation of ills such as environmental degradation, aesthetic impoverishment, large gap between the rich and poor, crime and social disintegration.<br /><br />This book inspired me in several ways. First, I'm inspired to make graceful simplicity a way of life by reducing consumption, increasing my leisure time, developing relationships and doing work that is fulfilling. Second, I'm inspired to help create a society where genuine progress can be made and where government policies enable people to live a better lives.<br /><br />Economist John Maynard Keyes predicted in 1900 that eventually society will overcome the problem of having to get a living.  Economic growth will no longer be necessary. Instead, we could focus on the primary problem of humanity, how to live better more virtuous lives. Shouldn't we be using our wealth towards better ends than simply creating more wealth?  Couldn't we use it to help the poor, restore the environment, and enable ordinary people to work less and enjoy their lives more?<br /><br />This book is so relevant. I really hope that the tide is changing and we will give serious consideration to the new American dream.","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

I often am the one who gets to play with them and do all the fun stuff with the kids (which I certainly don't complain about).

This one has the magic. Virgil is a fully realized, well rounded and quirky character. He's smart and he's unpredictable.    In this book, a series of Vietnam vets have been murdered. Lemons have been left in their mouths, supposedly something the Vietnamese did to prisoners who were about to be executed. It turns out that one of the American vets had gone on a rampage near the end of the war, killing an innocent family and raping a young woman. Now, the young woman's father, a high government official in Vietnam, has dispatched a hit team, seeking revenge.    Virgil, who made his first appearance in the Prey series, seemed in the last book to be a pale echo of Lucas Davenport. Sandford has evidently (and wisely) decided that the best way to lend Virgil his mentor's gravitas is to have the two spend a lot of time together. Davenport is a major character in this book, guiding and controlling the younger man's investigation, a little like M to Virgil's James Bond. Three times in the book, it is stated that Virgil is \\""just like Davenport,\\"" the last by Virgil himself, who adds, \\""when you were younger.\\"" Davenport smiles and says, \\""Not much younger.\\""    The book ends with a ferocious bang, skewering the pomposity and pretensions of the Feds and setting us up for many more volumes of what has turned into a terrific series.","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

Lorraine's style of writing was easy to read, moved along nicely and always kept my interest.  The sisters, Laura and Dee with the help of other family members are able to piece together the lives of their great grandmothers.  Laura finds she is able to relate to her great grandmother in a very personal and very unusual way.  As she learns more of the family's past she is able to look at her own life in a more positive light.  I liked the way Lorraine gently wove the past, the present and the future together and in the end she realizes what is most important in her life is family.  I think her dedication sums it up beautifully:  For My Great Grandmothers Ane and Sara -- They Are My Past  For My Sons John and Chris -- They Are My Future  For My Husband Jim -- He Is My Now  This book is a delight for anyone to read but especially for so many of us who are searching or would like to start searching for the story of our family's past.

I enjoy the series greatly, even though there are remnants of the days when the author was primarily a writer of romantic novels (the heroine's husband is impossibly rich and handsome, and the sexual encounters between them are always overwhelmingly passionate), and some of the dialogue between the heroine and her husband is too predictable. But generally the dialogue, especially with the supporting characters, is realistic and fun, and all the main and supporting characters have depth and very distinct personalities. I'd enjoy spending an evening or working with these people, not just the heroine and her husband, but also her friends and co-workers, and so I enjoy reading about them. The crimes are sometimes pretty gruesome, often with a sexual aspect, and the killers generally psychopaths - these are NOT cozy mysteries. The horrific childhood of the heroine is a major element in the books.  Mostly, the plots have been pretty good, not too repetitive or predictable, though I read this series for the characters and not the plots.  A good read, if you don't mind the gruesome parts.","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

I'll give my 2 cents worth from a beginner's perspective.<br /><br />First, understand that I have only been playing guitar about 9 months and started a bit late in life.  So I'm not some high school kid that picks things up at warp speed and is shredding Yngwie in a few months.  I do a lot of reading, though and watch a lot of youtube to understand techniques.  This was actually my first real book, though...unless you count the excellent Practical Music Theory pdf from Justin Guitar.  Anyway, the point is that the techniques covered in this book were familiar to me even though I had not mastered them.<br /><br />So, I would agree that if you just picked up a guitar yesterday, this book is likely way over your head unless you have someone more experienced available to help walk you through it.  It does not &#34;teach&#34; you anything per se, other than to provide exercises/drills to help you hone some really good techniques.<br /><br />The CDs included are helpful.  I've only used one so far, but it helps to understand how the exercises are supposed to sound with respect to TIMING.  This is one thing I have seen emphasized over and over so I am focusing on timing as I learn new material.<br /><br />As for the exercises themselves, I confess I'm only on week 3 and I've had the book about 4 months.  I don't use this book exclusively, though.  I revisit it from time to time to go back over the exercises.  Some of the exercises are not too difficult and just take some time to get up to speed.  I try to get most of them up to 80-100 bpm before moving to the next week.  The difficult one for me is sweep picking.  It just takes a lot more time than the others.  I did peek at some of the more advanced exercises and found them pretty interesting.  Some of those are not necessarily that much more difficult, just more notes to play.<br /><br />So overall at this point I'm pretty happy.  It provides some good exercises for helping with techniques and it changes things up slightly each week.  If you've been playing a little while I think it would be helpful.  If you are just starting out, I would recommend something different to actually &#34;teach&#34; you how to play first then come back to this to work on your chops.","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

Both are outstanding reading even if Unfinished does recover some familiar grounds of it's predecessor. I can't say enough about Richard Stearns in regards to his dedication to fight world poverty.

They are aided in their quest by three alien beings: Mrs Whatsit, Mrs Who and Mrs Which. With their help Meg and her brother  travel throughout the galaxy, learn what has happened to their father and confront a monstrous evil.<br /><br />'A Wrinkle in Time' reminded me a lot of what would happen if CS Lewis had written his 'Space Trilogy' for children. However L'Engle is not as good a writer as Lewis, and the plot is a little bit of a mess. Like Lewis's Narnian Chronicles there is a Christian theme to this book, but it is much more overt. Written in the late fifties the book describes the battle between good and evil. Evil is represented by the planet of Camazotz, which is obviously meant to evoke an authoritarian communist society. Subtlety is not L'Engle's strong suit, although to be fair it is a kid's book. The theme of the value of the individual and freedom is a worthy one in my opinion and kids will enjoy the story without noticing any of the problems that bothered me. It is a good book to introduce them to fantasy and science fiction, especially for young girls, as Meg is an admirable heroine.","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

It's been with me for 25 years of my life. It's become a good friend. Of course, since it took so long for all these books to come out, I had to read them over, and over, and over in order to remember everything that happened.<br />Through each read I found something new (or something I had forgotten).<br /><br />Being the final book this was an emotional end to a long journey.<br />I feel that Sanderson did a great job on these books - picking up where Jordan left off. There were some ways you could tell the writer wasn't the same (the lengthy descriptions of evvverrrrything were gone haha). However he did a wonderful job tying up this series.<br /><br />For this book - it had a satisfying ending - though still left me with many, many questions. Which, apparently (after much internet digging) Jordan wanted it that way - to leave some things ambiguous for the reader to figure out. As much as I like these kind of endings - after 25 years I would have preferred to have everything tied up. I don't enjoy having mysteries left for me to figure out - especially since the author is dead and there will probably be no clarification later.<br /><br />Anyway, great read. Great series! I will be reading them again and again for sure.","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

When I saw the title of Sarah Mae's new book, Longing for Paris: One Woman's Search for Joy, Beauty, and Adventure-Right Where She Is...it snagged me.  I had to read it.<br /><br />When life moved us here to Colorado, I felt like I lost a piece of myself.  A piece of my Paris.  I had things in order.  I had direction.  I may not have been enjoying my job, but I had a sense of purpose.  And then when we moved, I lost it all.  Becoming a SAHM felt like I was giving up every part of me, those dreams and desires I had as a full-time, working outside the home mom.  I know being a mom, being a parent, means to sacrifice self for your family.  But what about those dreams I had? How long would I have to put them on hold?<br /><br />So when I began scrolling through the book, I prayed that the Holy Spirit would show me where I needed to focus.  3 things stood out to me, about me in this season:<br />1. I am blessed.<br />2.  God cares about my dreams.<br />3.  I am perfect.<br /><br />You can check out a more comprehensive view here: http://kateheadley.weebly.com/blog/find-your-dreams-in-the-everyday-3-things-i-learned-from-sarah-mae-longingforparis","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

This magnifier fits the bill perfectly!<br /><br />The magnifier is not too heavy and the handle is comfortable to hold, sized so that a child or an adult male, and everybody in between, should not find it uncomfortable.  The light is aimed just right to clarify what you are magnifying.  Just a little extra illumination to help you see.  There is little distortion, so it isn't overly tiring to the eyes.  The small 4X magnifying 'bubble' is placed in a good position and is nice for the extra-fine details.  The button for the light is easy to reach.  It is just enough for now to help out until glasses become a necessity.  I also bought one for my Mom, who has more serious vision problems, and can use the extra help a lot more often than me.<br /><br />The magnifier is 2X magnification, the 'bubble' is 4X magnification, the light is LED, and it takes 2 AAA batteries, which are included.  The only two things I would change would be to include a slipcase for protection, travel and storage, and to make the handle 'click' into place for more stability.  This would not keep me from buying it, but it would be nice to add these features.","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

Yet, in the careful hands of its translators and editors, \\""The Plantagenet Chronicles\\"" brings us a cogent record of two and a half critical centuries. On the whole the original contributors managed to avoid self-consciousness--although self-righteousness was another matter. Many of the Chronicles' entries began life as personal letters. Great events of the day mixed with gossip and the trivia of local events. Thus the maiming of a horse took a share of ink and precious parchment from one of the most momentous events of the twelfth century, the murder of Archbishop Thomas Becket. To read this exquisite compendium is to imagine monkish figures bent over quills in poor light, huddling beneath their cowls. They nurse the warmth of guttering candle-flame fanned by winter drafts in a dark scriptorium. Add the sound of wind, a scratching quill, an island of flickering light in a darkness of damp stone, and the vision is complete.<br /><br />\\""The Plantagenet Chronicles\\"" grew, story by story, layer upon layer, until men such as Ralph of Coggeshall and Ralph de Diceto had compiled a curious mixture; several centuries worth of major and minor events in medieval France and England. And what centuries! Unceasing violence and prayer, fear and the clash of mortal enemies, life under the spiritual and temporal threats of priests and overlords. Here is the failure of King Henry II's and the German emperor's crusade, brought down because \\""God despised [the armies], for they abandoned themselves to open fornication and to adulteries hateful to God...\\"" On the other hand, when monkish opinion detected the Almighty's favor, the Chronicles bring us entry upon entry of the blood-stained heroics that built Henry II's Angevin empire, a swathe of the richest land in Europe stretching from the Scottish border to the Pyrenees. Then comes that curious, love-hate relationship between the king and the queen who bore his sons, the subtle, driving Eleanor of Aquitaine.<br /><br />If much of \\""The Plantagenet Chronicles\\"" leads us through the building of King Henry's empire, the closing chapters tear that empire down: the book draws to a close after the barons forced the Magna Carta on King John, just after the fates of France and England were finally severed and torn apart. The temper of the Chronicles is constant: immense events interweave with and surrender space to the mundane and the trite.

For almost everyone else (who has not read the book I am reviewing) the only association was that Boswell was Samuel Johnson's biographer and faithful friend.  Even if the reader had not gone beyond the link to Johnson, which of course was true, one had chanced upon a most curious and important person from the 18'th century.  Having read the biography I am so much more impressed with the life that the irrepressible James Boswell lived.  He shared many psychological imperfections, tendencies and real manifestations with his great hero, Johnson.  While they both suffered from depression, Boswell also endured even greater magnitudes of hypochondria.  In his case both mental states could lay him so low that he ceased to be able to function and on the worst of the occasions, he was unable to get out of bed for days on end.  Both men loved to drink but Johnson knew where his drinking would take him and he firmly grabbed hold of those wild horses and put them in the stable and locked the door.  Boswell went in the other direction, giving in to greater bouts of intoxication.  I am pretty sure that this life of abusive drinking probably shortened his life span by many years.  Both men were endowed with strong physical lusts but again in the case of Johnson, he channeled his deeply religious and guilt-ridden sensibility into sexual self control.  Like most of the clouds that hung over his life, it is seen that he never was able to be comfortable in his own skin and was constantly at work tormenting himself with fearful ideas about an after life of endless punishments, presumably the worst of which would be doled out for sexual misconduct or failures to show proper respect to his parents.  This was Johnson.  Boswell was never one to take religious piety in hand and once in hand to stab himself with pangs of certainty, of the punishments after death.  However, where he lacked Johnson's certainty about his moral maps and compasses, Boswell more than made up for in his unquenchable thirst for insights into metaphysical ideas.  He was both repulsed, fascinated and drawn to atheistic philosophers, hearing them out and being frightened at their logical assertions about God and the role of humans in society.  Johnson would turn to God and prayer when the dark nights of his soul passed by; Boswell turned to ask more and more questions and when firmly frightened, hit the prostitutes and the bottle.  Oh, and there was also his really creepy fascination for watching public hangings, which he watched many times. Was he concerned that maybe he'd end up on the stand?  Boswell had a sexual drive that would suffice for at least a dozen normal males.  He also never quite made it to full adult sexual consciousness.  What I mean is that he refused to accept the consequences of giving vent to any and all sexual fantasies even when he knew full well that it was probably going to end badly.  And end badly it did, over and over and over again.  He contracted gonorrhoea at least 18 times!  He fathered illegitimate children.  He could not stop himself or would not stop himself from physically and sexually interacting with just about any woman who caught his fancy.  And the recourse to prostitutes is shocking to read about; that dark colour streaks across the Boswell canvas from the age of about 19 till his dying days.  Boswell's childish habit of telling all his dirty behaviour to his prime female figure, his wife, seeing her explode with outrage, hatred, revulsion and betrayal and then waiting for and getting her forgiveness, each and every time - this tarnishes his image in our minds and shocks.  Simply put, he would leave his note books about the house for his wife to read and read she would, about who he slept with last, and how he contracted yet another venereal disease.  It became a type of demented ritual with him.  And strange enough, he didn't change and hiswife continued to forgive and put up with his antics.  These are parts of Bossie's dark side, a very substantial dark side.  But, there were other sides to his nature.  Boswell was possessed of a preternatural self assurance that was far in advance from and not sourced from his young years; when he landed in Holland to study law, he was a young man but his assurance, even if an act, impressed just about everyone.  Well, not quite everyone.  There were those whose eyes were open and wise enough to know a silly and ridiculous person when they saw one.  Boswell's great strength was to be able to laugh along with those who laughed at him, even if they did so with derision and disdain.  His psychic roots needed attention and even if it came to him in a negative tone, it was attention nonetheless.  It is obvious that when Boswell agreed to go to learn law in Holland, it was as a sop to his overly stern but very practical father.  Creeping upwards in Boswell's mind was the opportunity to become a rake and whore his way through Europe with the eventual fleshpot of Italy as his destination. And that's pretty much what he accomplished, much to his fathers anguish and rage.  Along the way in Europe he managed to meet many very important personalities of the era including Jean Jacque Rousseau and Voltaire.  His Corsica journey reads like the plot of a zany novel except that he wrote the plot and acted out the drama.  It is both hilarious to read and descriptive of the lengths that he would take to create an interesting life.  Always present in James Boswell's mind was that part of life that he loathed, the work that his father excelled at.  He hated the drudgery of law and formality and the back slapping and banter of other lawyers.  If you recall the incredibly funny moment in &#34;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&#34;, where an effeminate son of a castle owning baron is being berated by his father, telling him how many times he built the castle and how often it sunk into the swamp, and that one day it would all be his.  To which his son says &#34;....but father, I want to sing!&#34;  That is Boswell in a nutshell.  He wanted to do anything to distance himself from his fathers way of life.  And yet, therein lies the troublesome core of James real needs: he wanted to be accepted and loved by his father for who he was, not for who his father insisted he become.  And, rail against this as much as he did, he ended up becoming the successful barrister that his father had tried to fashion him into and against which James writhed in agony.  Eventually James would marry and raise a family.  Peter Martin makes the case pretty clear that the dipoles in Boswell's life turned into Scotland, his life as a barrister, Laird, father and husband on one side and London, with his beloved Johnson and a growing batch of literary, artistic and political bright lights on the other.  He was one of the most devoted and productive note takers, journal keepers and snapshot describers in the whole of the 18'th century.  His writing was initially not as well appreciated as they have become.  His magnum opus, the massive biography of Johnson, became a huge best seller and ran into dozens of editions in that century, most of which came out after Boswell's death.  So much of the colours and textures of Johnson as a person come from the &#34;Life&#34; and only add to the massive body of written work that Johnson left posterity.  I actually cannot think of another man from that time period who wrote more than he did.  Peter Martin draws on Boswell's journals, which showed up quite unexpectedly in several places early in the 20'th century.  There is much in this book that is very funny to read.  Boswell could make friends as well as enemies and those came about usually because of ill considered or ill timed comments that a more mature mind would have shared with the closest of circles with the understanding that the words didn't leave the room.  Not for Boswell this type of self control.  Not for Boswell were the words that came out of his mouth or written in pamphlets, letters or essays to be put through an internal censor.  And, silly person that he was, even when his wise friends read what he wanted to publish and they recoiled in horror and warned him to suppress it, he almost always disregarded the advice, threw the words into the world like a well placed grenade and then waited for the explosion and the &#34;attention&#34;.  That was Boswell.  His reckless views ended up coming back to haunt him when he tried with all his might in the last chapters of his life to become a barrister in the English court system, centred in London.  It didn't help his cause that he was unable to fully comprehend the English judicial system, something that Peter Martin does not explain.  Boswell's life fell apart in two distinct ruptures.  The first being the death of Johnson and the second the death of Boswell's wife.  He was never the same after this and his spiral into almost complete dissolution, alcoholism, depression and hypochondria, eventually led to a sudden disease and rapid decline.  Boswell was very fortunate to have found a very great friend in Malone who made sure that the &#34;Life&#34; was edited and polished and who helped guide, as best he could, Boswell's children.  Since the discovery of the huge trove of Boswellian journal pages and publications of them and critical essays about his work, his reputation as a writer has only increased.  As a person, Peter Martin shows us the fullness of Boswell's character and a complicated person was he.  But, I think that Martin would have us delve into the journal pages were we to come face to face with Boswell as he really was.  Lucky for us that those journals are affordable and in print.  Martin's biography is wonderfully written, with love, respect and honour.  All the things that Bossie would have craved; they are all in this terrific book.","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

I would not have expected that of a brand new 2008 publication. The image quality of the text is far from as bad as for many out of print laser printed on demand books (it is similar to print outs of first generation 300 dpi laser printers of the late 1980s).

The grain direction (the direction of the fibers) of the paper used for the interior of this book, is wrong (running horizontally, and not vertically as usual for books). This fault contributes greatly to the mouse trap effect. It also explains the somewhat stiff and awkward way the book behaves when I turn pages and move around in the book.

One of the other reviewers talked about the necessity of having a dictionary at hand - that is an understatement.  The book is written at an intellectual and vocabulary level well beyond that of most college graduates - including those holding advanced degrees.  The amount of arcane information is incredible and the reader (at least this reader) spends an inordinate amount of time attempting to comprehend what is written.  As far as comprehending the \\""plethora of insights contained in the book\\"", I found the text so laborious that whatever insights were intended were completely lost on me.  I had read reviews for this book prior to buying it that praised the revelations, insights, humor, creativity, etc. of the author and his writing style.  After plowing through the book - no small task, it is very difficult reading - I have to say whatever the publisher meant by \\""packed with meaning\\"" is completely lost on me.  The story is not all that riveting, although the suspense does build throughout if one is dilligent enough to filter out the academic garbage.  The ending is not surprising and is somewhat disapponting.  Overall, upon completing the book, I found myself thinking that Mr. Eco is very impressed with himself and his academic mind and outdid himself in this attempt to show the world his vast command of language, semiotics and arcane data.  I can only imagine that a student of semiotics or perhaps a select and quite small audience of highly educated literary scholars would find this book at all rewarding or enjoyable.    As far as the rest of the intelligent, educated, thoughtful and/or introspective readers in this world go, my advice is not to waste your time - this book is not worth the effort.","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

This book should provide a moment of pause to those of us who are, or aspire to be wealthy so we can gather up our common sense and clutch it tightly to our chest so that our lives will not only be filled with financial freedom and liberty but also health and happiness.","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

There’s a sense among the optimistic in this country that this period of hyperpartisanship is fleeting, and it will abate itself in due time as cooler heads prevail. What this book does, however, is give a very convincing argument that Washington, in essence, is a microwave, due to systemic exploits that allow the minority party an almost unlimited ability to obstruct the policy of the majority – from big initiatives like the Affordable Care Act, to even the smallest of judicial appointments being bogged in filibusters and cloture votes. What were once rarely-used procedural stalls are now used on a routine basis – and what’s worse is they are now paired with a zealous pragmatism for the party that stands most against government (the Republican Party) to sabotage government institutions for its own electoral game. Once you see it for what it is, it becomes increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to see a future where this is not only going to get worse, but could cause a collapse in all semblance of reasonable governing ability as our government, due to the bomb-throwing, limps from crisis to crisis, powerless to act.<br /><br />The book was a solid, fact-based argument that this is not a fleeting destructiveness in our national dialogue but a likely permanent and worsening condition that undermines the very idea of democratic government to the benefit of one political party that is no longer interested in dialogue with a party they increasingly see as baby-killing America-hating tyrants.<br /><br />The breath of fresh air from this book is that it doesn’t stake the ground of the muddled middle and make the standard “both sides need a babysitter” appeal – although the Democrats have been responsible for engaging in some of this horseplay, the blame mostly rests on the Republican Party for some of the more egregious violations of good faith, such as the reckless shutting down of the federal government in 2011 that revealed leadership was openly considering government as a “hostage to be ransomed” (McConnell’s words) rather than an institution that would work for the benefit of all of the American people.<br /><br />The book shines light on a growing problem and insists that it is not going to correct itself on its own. What I feel the book inadequately addressed was how the obvious inadequacies of the U.S. Constitution is primarily responsible for the gridlock and the bomb-throwing. The Republicans tsk tsk the Democrats and their judicial activists for not following an originalist perspective; that is, a perspective that binds government action to what the U.S. Constitution meant to those who wrote it and its amendment. This gives them the staging ground they need to launch into attacks that the Democrats are not sufficiently devoted to the sacraments of our founders, to delegitimize their opponents. Meanwhile there is a sense that Republicans, by destroying the government and privatizing society, also do not believe in the U.S. Constitution – in an environment that everything is privatized, what good is the U.S. Constitution for a government drowned in its own bathtub of toxic waste? The dysfunction, therefore, has its roots in the interpretation of the U.S. Constitution – one side wants to interpret it liberally and read it with the perspective of a 21st century mind, whereas the other wants to hold government exactly to what the U.S. Constitution meant to yeoman farmers in the late 1700’s. Either way spends the U.S. Constitution as a force of law – but it is not so much the goal that the two-party system disagrees on, but their differing methods that causes all the acrimony and bitterness between the two. At the same time, neither party can bring themselves to really admit the repeal of the U.S. Constitution as an authority of law is the primary goal – because the U.S. Constitution biases a two-party system, and in the event of its collapse, it could bring about an entirely new dynamic which could see both of these parties as relics of history.  One party wants to bring the U.S. Constitution into the 21st century (with a potential unmooring of its guiding principles, redefining the entire nation, its purpose and its law) whereas the other party wants the interpretation to be firmly stuck in 1700’s jurisprudence (with a potential collapse of laws now unable to respond to current governing needs, privatizing the entire nation).<br /><br />This book is a good read. It jogs you to accepting that the Obama era is not just a blip of hostility in our otherwise staid democratic methods, but the beginning of a possibly permanent collapse in our system of government and its ability to respond to real needs and real problems.nstitution biases a two-party system, and in the event of its collapse, it could bring about an entirely new dynamic which could see both of these parties as relics of history.

While Arabella secretly writes mystery novels under a \\""masculine\\"" pen name, she desperately wants to learn about one mystery that has escaped her all her life (due mostly to her spinsterhood)... the concept of sexual desire.<br /><br />And what better way to be educated on such a concept than to sneak into an opulent brothel?<br /><br />While that might seem like a very improper act for a supposedly proper Regency miss--an act that could very well ruin her reputation, it's a sacrifice Arabella is willing to make in her quest for knowledge. Anyway, who's going to know? All she has to do is get in, do her research, and leave. No harm, no foul, right?<br /><br />Grayson St. James, Lord Mercer, has just returned from fighting in the Napoleonic wars and wishes for nothing more than peace--and of course, to solve the mystery surrounding his brother's suicide. But first, Grayson seeks to acquire some rest from his travels, which brings him to \\""The Constantine\\"", a brothel he'd spent many a night in during his youth.<br /><br />So imagine his surprise when he finds a strange woman hiding beneath his bed?<br /><br />Regina Carlysle is a fabulous story teller! With engaging characters that you can't help but fall in love with (this includes her secondary characters--I simply adored Arabella's aunts) and a mystery to be solved, Made for Mischief is a delicious book that will satisfy the cravings of any Regency romance fan.","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

In fact, it's not a diet book at all. It is a meticulous deconstruction of the colossal fraud that has been unwittingly perpetrated on the American public in the realm of health care. And there are named villains whose crime is excessive pride, intellectual dishonestly, and perhaps greed.<br /><br />Years ago I started on a modified Atkins diet to lose ten pounds. It's simple and it worked. I cut back on bread and pastries and carbohydrate snacks. I also cut back on sugary drinks of any kind and stopped adding sweeteners to coffee or tea. I didn't worry about eating meat, lean or otherwise. I did not starve myself though I admit for the first few weeks I was tempted to go off the wagon. There's a reason for that. Sweets and carbs can be physically addictive. However, the craving for such foods diminishes over time so it's no big deal.<br /><br />I was puzzled in subsequent years when I read in various newspapers and magazines that the Atkins diet was mocked by the medical establishment, and alarmed when they warned that it could be bad for you. This book has put my worries to rest. It's highly technical and at times tedious but all in all it's a powerful read. I learned a lot about insulin, homeostasis, triglycerides, cholesterol, fatty acids, the role of the hypothalamus, etc., and, too be frank, another reading or two would be helpful to cement the mass of information that is crammed between the front and back cover. If you enjoy popular science books and are interested in the current state of opinion on dieting and nutrition and heart disease and obesity then I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />Finally, and most importantly IMO: the nature of the debate on low fat vs. low carb dieting and the manner in which the low carb diet was ridiculed by the establishment is reminiscent of the current global warming debate. In both cases the science was and continues to be politicized. Any evidence that does not conform to the prevailing opinion of the 'scientific' establishment is downplayed, ignored, or denigrated. Funding goes only to true believers.ling opinion of the 'scientific' establishment is downplayed, ignored, or denigrated. Funding goes only to true believers.","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

He was far more hurt than he thought possible and he strove to erase her from his mind, but when he sees her again at a memorial service for her cousin he can't help but remember that night. Then someone at the service mentions that Maribel has a child and he's angry that she's been with some other man. He goes to see her, not knowing exactly what he wants from her but then he's stunned to realize that Maribel's child is his son. He's equally stunned by Maribel's passionate vow that she will never let him near her child. Leonidas is determined to use all his considerable resources to gain his rights as the father and at first Maribel fights him. She wants nothing to do with him and doesn't want her son emulating his father's careless, playboy ways. She thinks to drive him away by saying the only way that Leonidas will be allowed into their lives is if he marries her. Well, Leonidas accepts her offer and they marry. For better or worse these two tempestuous lovers need to find a compromise that will enable them to have a happily ever after.<br /><br />My favorite in the Rich, Ruthless and Really Handsome series. I liked Maribel and I enjoyed her evading maneuvers. At first her insistence on cutting Leonidas out of his sons life seems cold but when we learn more about that fateful morning after they had sex it becomes more apparent that she has valid reasons in protecting herself and her son. I completely sympathize with her hurt and cheered when she brought Leonidas to his knees. Who was an arrogant jerk. When they finally do have sex as man and wife and then he rolls off her and agrees to meet his ex girlfriend at her apartment my jaw just dropped. Grrrr. Someone get me a blowtorch and a butcher's knife! That it was completely innocent doesn't matter. He frequently tells her that she doesn't own him and that their marriage will not change him. Grrrr. I definitely enjoyed reading about Maribel bringing him down a peg or three. Normally I don't like angsty books but all these out of control emotions was a fun ride. Also it's a good thing I read this book before the first one in this series because I would have really disliked Leonidas alot more. He has an obvious disdain for women in the first book and it's still not beaten out of him by his own book but Maribel soons straightens him out and makes him into a better father and a far better husband.definitely enjoyed reading about Maribel bringing him down a peg or three.

Susan George impersonates her brother, who is a private investigator and is hired by a rich client to find a missing cat.<br /><br />  She spends a lot of time complaining about how unhappy she is with the state of her life and comparing her average middle-class lifestyle to that of her rich client.<br /><br />While some of this most likely done for the sake of comedy, at times it has the opposite effect, and made readers sympathize with the protagonist’s plight.  If Luna Susan George were brought to life on the big screen if wouldn’t be far off the mark to have someone like Queen Latifah play her.<br /><br />Readers who live in Los Angeles or even those who have visited the city will appreciate the author’s references to famous landmarks like The Getty and neighborhoods like Malibu and Beverly Hills.<br /><br />Although Tyler’s writing could be more polished and his word choices simplified in some places, his style is breezy and filled with references to both pop culture and art history, which make the book fun to read.<br /><br />One Little Lie is a mystery novel with elements of chick lit. Carrie Bradshaw stole the cat, stashed it in her Fendi bag and made a clean getaway in her Manolo Blahniks.<br /><br />During the course of her investigation Luna strikes up an unlikely romance with a police detective so fans of the romance genre might enjoy this aspect of the novel as well.<br /><br /> Tyler’s protagonist is so realistically endearing that readers can easily overlook his tendency to repeat certain words and phrases in order to get readers into the character’s mindset.<br /><br /> If you enjoy mysteries and have a sense of humor, this may be the perfect story for you.","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

But a lot has changed from the first book. All the girls now have boyfriends, except for Kelly. Sydney and Drew have gotten back together, but there seems to be a little trouble brewing there. Raven and Horace are having to spend a painful month apart, but will the flirty Raven remember her love for him when he's gone? Alexia is spending a lot of her time with her boyfriend, Ben. Then it comes time for \\""the talk\\"", but is Alexia ready to make that decision? Since Kelly is single, Alexia comes up with the idea for them to make a Crush Code, since they no longer need the Breakup Code. This new code is hopefully going to help Kelly snag her crush on the gym guy, Adam. And with forty one rules, this should be easy. But what happens when Kelly realizes that she's actually crushing on someone that she can't have?<br /><br />Reading The Crushes is like reading a book about your best friends. You get into the story and really start caring about the characters. Honestly I was rooting for all of the girls to do what makes them happy and hopefully find the happiness that each girl deserves. It's a real book with real situations and can be relate able for any girl. You don't necessarily have to read The Heartbreaks first, although I would recommend that you do, so that you can get a background on each of the girls and their situations in the story. If you haven't read this series yet, then I highly suggest that you do so. So run to your nearest bookstore (or library) and pick this up. You won't be disappointed. Plus, you'll have some good reads over the Christmas holidays for when your family starts to drive you crazy!<br /><br />Also, there will be two more books in the series, so keep your eyes out for those to come soon!","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

Not boring and complicated like other astrology books.  The sign descriptions are so specific and accurate it is incredible.  My whole life I felt like my sign (Taurus) only applied to part of me and that in several ways I don't fit the placid, slow, sensual bull at all.  Then I read my combined sign in Ms. White's book and WOW! The missing half of me!  I am a Taurus Tiger and her description of this combination fits me COMPLETELY.  The book is breathtakingly (as in &#34;Gasp! I can't believe how true this is!&#34;) accurate about my family members, friends, and exes (&#34;Oh, so THAT's why it all went so terribly wrong so quickly&#34;), employers, and co-workers.<br /><br />My older sister is a Capricorn Ox.  Knowing her sign combination early in life would have saved me from a lot of frustration.  Because you cannot argue with a Capricorn Ox.  There is just no point. I have not wasted a minute trying to reason with her since I read her sign, and we have had a lot more pleasant times together.  Also, I figured out how to stand up to her, WITHOUT arguing, and not back down.  I let go of caring whether she understood my point/needs and refused to be drawn into long arguments. I ignored her outrage and her comments about how immature it was of me to not explain myself.  Because the Capricorn/Ox is selfish and stubborn and will just attack all your reasons and explanations and pretend they don't understand your valid points. They want to win and they want it to be their way. Period.<br /><br />I love how Suzanne White uses anecdotes and examples to make things clear.  I am going to use one to make my previous paragraph clear.  I was visiting my sister at her house a couple years ago and from her house I drove to our mother's house to visit her.  My sister drove in her car to visit our mom also.  She wanted me to follow her.  I don't like following people when I drive. She insisted.  She said she wanted to show me a shortcut.  I said, &#34;Here's my map, just show me on the map.&#34;  She refused. In the old days I would have followed her, to avoid her wrath or a long argument that she would win anyway, after she'd worn me down.  This time, I said, cheerily,  &#34;Okay, well, I'm going to go my usual way.&#34;  I got in my car and drove the usual, long way. This was a FIRST!  Hard to believe, I know. She was smoldering furious at me for three days.  Over a tiny thing like that.  Capricorn/Ox, people. Every tiny thing MUST be their way.  But on the other hand, reading her sign description caused me to appreciate her good points more.  Loyal, very giving in their own way.<br /><br />I used this book to understand a former manager. I started using what I learned about him, in my first week in my new job, to avoid hurting his ego or setting off any of his many triggers (his was not a good sign).  He was a total nightmare psycho to everyone except me. People were amazed.<br /><br />I love how truthful this book is.  It makes it actually USEFUL.  Other books seem to want to just tell people nice things they want to hear.  And if it bothers people that some signs have a lot of negative in them, just keep in mind that our personalities and character and life choices are influenced by many other things, as well.  Jack Nicholson and Adolf Hitler have (had?) the same sign combination but Jack Nicholson didn't start a Holocaust.","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

The lead character is Harry Bosch, the leader of a 3 detective team in the LAPD that is assigned an unusually sensitive case. A well-known civil rights attorney that has successfully sued LAPD over and over again for violations of federal civil rights laws has been murdered on the eve of an especially notorious case against the LAPD. Of course, everyone inside LAPD and out believe that a police officer killed him in a fit of revenge and the city is seething.<br /><br />Set just a few years after the Rodney King riots and the O.J. Simpson murder trial, Los Angeles is racially tense, to say the least. This works well with one of the main themes of the entire series - Harry Bosch's name. Harry's real name is Hieronymus Bosch. If you are not familiar with Hieronymus Bosch let me explain. The real Hieronymus Bosch is a Renaissance painter that painted detailed and fanciful paintings of the torments of hell, including demons, strange creatures and their victims. Connelly often presents Harry Bosch as a man walking among the sites and smells of hell - torture, betrayal, riots and the literal burning of parts of the city in protest are the backdrop of this moody, brooding book.<br /><br />Connelly deftly handles the tricky topic of racial discrimination and issues of black and white in this book. While the case is being worked race tints every aspect of the case - Black vs. White vs. Blue (LAPD) is a frequent topic that is discussed - not overtly but neatly inserted as conversations that flow quite naturally in the context of the story.<br /><br />I heard this book as an audiobook and it was truly a joy to hear Dick Hill's narration. He's done several of Connelly's novels and I've never been disappointed with any that he's narrated. He is as good as it gets.he's narrated. He is as good as it gets.","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

And so it is with Katinka Loeser and the realm of parenthood.  If you have ever had a child, or if you've ever been one, you cannot fail to be moved by these short stories.    The range of this colleciton is wide, its mood varied.  In \\""The Permanent End\\"" Miss Loeser writes wryly of the equivocal satisfaction of a mother in being not so much loved by her brood as tolerated, needed and taken for granted; in \\""Whose Little Girl Are You?\\"" her picture of the unconcern of a little girl with only a few months to live and the terrible bravery of her mother is wrenchingly conpassionate.  Another story, \\""There Are Smiles,\\"" manages in a few lines of dialogue and description to capture completely the swagger and doubt, humor and tenderness, of a growing boy.  While, with a touch of fantasy, \\""End of a Season\\"" reviews both a summer and a lifetime in a story that is at once homely and sophisticated, both funny and sad.  These storis are marked by a strong sense of the flow of life between generations, from younger to older, as well as from parent to child.\\""","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

Moreover, the experience of being bullied can change the course of their future from a bright one full of success to a mediocre one, or even worse.  In some cases, bullies have even overstepped their bounds and accidentally killed their victim.  Bullying is a serious issue, yet little is ever done about it in schools and neighborhoods.  Jay McGraw's book is written to be read by children themselves and by the adults that care about them, and it is full of simple pointers and solutions that are easy to carry out.  If you know someone who is being bullied, this book is a good place to start.  Learning how to deal with bullies is a useful skill for any stage of life, but it's critical for chidren. I wish I'd had this book when I taught middle school.  In fact, I wish I'd had it when I was a kid.  We had bullies in my day too.  This book is easy to understand and very practical, and it even touches on the issue of forgiveness which is so vital to recovering from any abuse.  I recommend it.","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

My binding was tearing and required reading on a flat surface. The amount of information is so great it tends to repeat itself often and could have stood up to some serious editing if only to create more breathing space around the borders of the pages. The amount of spelling mistakes alone had me shrinking with embarrassment for the author.<br /><br />This is clearly a labor of love by one man who had a wealth of access and serious dedication to the source material and the subject's acquaintances. The amount of detail undermines the craft but I felt like there was no stone left unturned. In the end though a lot of what I learned made me far less impressed about the man behind the brush than anything.

Jack Schwartz's memoir, &#34;The Fine Print: My Life as a Deskman,&#34;  tracks his long journalistic career, beginning in the late 1950s when he got his first job as a copy boy at The Daily Mirror.  then one of 7 dailies in NY.  &#34;Like most of my fellow copy boys I was a college student by day, lackey by night.&#34;  All that copy editing taught Schwartz how to turn a phrase, distill a situation, tell a story.  For example, &#34;What struck me right off at The Mirror was that the copy boys spent their spare time reading and the rewrite men spent their spare time drinking&#34;.<br />Schwartz's enviable memory and fluid writing combine to recreate the feel of a mid-century newsroom.  Whether focusing on the clear hierarchy, the continual hazing, or the food runs for higher ups that provided a temporary escape for copy boys, Schwartz brings the scene to life.<br />Listen to Schwartz on mid-20th century  copy editing:  &#34;The system was simple enough.  We sat on a long wooden bench against a wall at the far end of the city room between the news desk and the banks of rewrite men.  If a writer finished a piece of copy...he'd yell &#34;Boy&#34; and the  copy boy on the far right,...would leap up, grab the copy from the writer, move it to the news desk strip the carbons and distribute the copies to the in baskets of the appropriate editors.&#34;<br /><br />While still a student at City College and working full time at the Mirror, Schwartz took a second job at the NY Post.  Once he graduated, he learned to drive (overnight!)  to accept a full time reporter's job at the Long Island Press.<br /><br />A short gig at the Herald Tribune in Paris sounds like a vacation, and contrasts with the sense of purpose, work ethic and culture of NYCnewspapers.<br /><br />Most of his long career at Newsday and the NY Times informs his experience and  perspective as a self-described &#34;mid level toiler&#34; and  reveals a great deal about the hierarchical structures at NY newspapers.and the hazing and abuse they inculcated.<br /><br />Schwartz worked with typesetters long before computers defined how  newspapers were laid out and produced, and describes the profound impact of computerization on the newspaper industry.<br /><br />He helped create many the &#34;specialist sections&#34; of Newsday, and the now defining, similar sections of the NY Times.<br /><br />Schwartz went back to edit NY Newsday's Book Review, in ???  where he really hit his stride.  It's exciting to read about how Schwartz created a book review intended to challenge and trump the NY Times.  His laser focus on finding the best reviewer for each book, on the ways that interviews added value...<br />Readers can't help wondering how different the landscape of NYC newspapers would have been had New York Newsday survived.<br />  Jan Rosenberg, Long Island University Professor of Sociology , retired","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

She met the quartet’s diminutive lead singer two years later.<br /><br />The backstage meeting would be the first of many, sporadic (and arguably more eventful) meetings between April and Frankie over a period of decades.  (By the time Kirkwood formally ended the affair, in 2008, prompted by circumstances that made the timing as appropriate as ever, she writes she had been Valli’s off-and-on sex partner for more than 20 years.)<br /><br />On her way to becoming Miss Ohio Teenage (1975), April lost her virginity at age 17 to the then-39-year-old married singer (whose given name is Francesco Stephen Castelluccio) in a burst of underage passion in Valli’s hotel room.<br /><br />Suffice to say April quickly learned the ways of a “successful” groupie and, while happy to provide a few pointers to concert fans in search of a meeting with their singing idol(s)  (“Go early when sound check is about to happen”), Kirkwood’s story, with Valli as its backdrop, is by her own admission a cautionary tale.<br /><br />When not bouncing back-and-forth between actualizing her fantasy life (“I wasn’t stupid; I was trusting.”) and reality (including the “Pentecostal brainwashing resonating in my head”), the beauty queen sought a degree from Oral Roberts University.<br /><br />Too questioning and rebellious to remain at ORU for very long, April parlayed her interest in astrology into more secular educational pursuits, obtaining two masters degrees in counseling that she has put to use as a social worker, guidance counselor and public speaker.<br /><br />Not to say that the author, who borrows titles from hits popularized by Frankie Valli and/or The Four Seasons  to separate the chapters in her memoir, has it all together: Twice married before meeting and beginning a 15-year-long affair with her then-married lover, Ron (whom April describes as “the only guy who could replace Frankie in my life”), Kirkwood calls both Frankie and Ron (whom, we suspect, will not answer if April calls him Ronnie) “uneducated” and “narcissistic.”<br /><br />Further, the mother of the late “serial cheater” Billy Kirkwood’s two children (daughter Dana Nicole and son, Grant) calls Dana (thankfully not named Sherry, Dawn, etc.), not Ron, her “soulmate.”<br /><br />While I’m a big Four Seasons fan, as a published author I’m well aware of the differences between memoir and biography.  As such, I wasn’t expecting to learn much more about Frankie Valli than I already know.<br /><br />What struck me, however, is April’s failure to realize that she never got to know (and maybe never cared to know) Francesco Castelluccio.  The emotional component of what Kirkwood hoped to have with Valli, even absent the sex that, given her availability, set the tone for their interaction early on, never transpired for reasons other than that murky, though in another context, fundamental foundation.<br /><br />While April, at 58, may still love Frankie (now age 81), her references to him (and her other Italian lovers) as a “dago,&#34; to name yet another of her uncomplimentary descriptions, suggests a love-hate relationshipthat never transcended the physicality of what Valli embodies and the persona of his celebrity.<br /><br />A reader finishes the book feeling that, during their time together, if Valli wanted to talk with Kirkwood about current events, his childhood friends, illnesses (his own or those he cares about), his favorite sports team, if any, and the like (in short, subjects that might speak more to who Frankie is than to whom April wanted him to be), April, bored to tears, would have been out of his hotel room in a heartbeat!ng that, during their time together, if Valli wanted to talk with Kirkwood about current events, his childhood friends, illnesses (his own or those he cares about), his favorite sports team, if any, and the like (in short, subjects that might speak more to who Frankie is than to whom April wanted him to be), April, bored to tears, would have been out of his hotel room in a heartbeat!","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

Azimi's book masterfully takes one through the last hundred years of Iranian politics. It is not necessary for one to have prior knowledge of the Iranian political scene before purchasing the book. The book lays out a concise history of the issues which played a role in the collapse of the Shah's regime and led to the Iranian Revolution. The role of oil and imperialism in Iran are also among the main themes of the book. One will see that the imperial governments of the west: England, France and United States along with Russia/Soviet Union all have had a significant influence not only in Iran but also other parts of the region for the past century. Azimi precisely and expertly explores how the powers of the west have manipulated the oil and politics of Iran and the Middle East for their own gains. Subsequent to reading this book one will be much more enlightened about the last hundred years in Iranian Politics. Many of the themes probed by Azimi are relevant to the current situation in Iraq, and offer an insight into what may be Iraq's future.","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

Dante features prominently in Mimesis, and this work furthers the theories he puts forth in that single chapter with more context for the reading of the Divine Comedy.  Using the philosophical histories of Plato, those of the writers who challenged his his ironic claims about the nature of art (something Plato would have relished), and the aesthetic philosophies that can be gleaned from the new testament, Auerbach argues that Dante made the most crucial step forward in the development of human representation in art by allowing the human subject a fullness that was not limited by predetermined factors of characterization and subsequently destroyed the hierarchy of which persons were allowed to have what pasts and current/future plots.<br /><br />Auerbach' s text is in no way opaque or privileged for only advanced literary students.  His prose is clear, showing a deep respect for the reader, and also carries with it a strong, poetic beauty.  The latter is a rare combination since so many critics from Aristotle to present day scholars forget that analysis can be art in its own way (Auerbach obviously heeded Plato's complexity in terms of how to write but achieves poesy in his criticism that would make Oscar Wilde proud).<br /><br />What you get with this book are the following benefits:<br />-Foremost, a concise and manageable study of Dante.<br />-A deepening of your ability to appreciate the grand scope of Dante' s project.<br />-A very bold but accurate theory of representation in literature, along with a short history of representation.<br />-An introduction to Auerbach' s great piece Mimesis.<br />-Finally, a more articulated understanding of Auerbach's literary thought, which will only improve your own analytical faculties.<br /><br />One final note, Auerbach--as the title of this study denotes--reveals a conception of Dante that seems completely incongruous with what we have been taught about the poet.  I feel this to be an important contribution that needs to be used to show the staggering importance of the Divine Pilgrim, who seems to be viewed as less and less necessary to contemporary readers.  Auerbach's controversial approach to Dante--who is a literary institution--helps to make Dante continuously accessible.ce Mimesis.<br />-Finally, a more articulated understanding of Auerbach's literary thought, which will only improve your own analytical faculties.<br /><br />One final note, Auerbach--as the title of this study denotes--reveals a conception of Dante that seems completely incongruous with what we have been taught about the poet.

In short, they keep your gut bacteria in check, helping to prevent gum disease, ulcers, and other diseases by enhancing the immune system. Dr. Gary Huffnagle, author of The Probiotics Revolution and Professor of Internal Medicine, Microbiology, and Immunology (University of Michigan Medical Center) researches probiotics.  He states that probiotics should be \\""one of our essential food groups because they provide nutrients just as important to our health as vitamins and minerals.\\""  Practicing what he preaches, Dr. Huffnagle has his family eating probiotics daily.<br /><br />Most of us have heard of yogurt containing these beneficial bacteria, but few know about kefir--a fermented milk drink.  Found in health food stores and larger supermarkets, it like yogurt is available both plain, lowfat, fruit flavored, and organic.  Kefir is prepared by mixing milk with a starter called \\""kefir grains,\\"" and then allowing it to ferment.  This optimizes the probiotic content.  Dr. Huffnagle explains that the amount of probiotic content in kefir is inferior when compared with yogurt, but the variety of good bacteria is better.  In fact, the bottle of kefir in my refrigerator contains ten varieties of live cultures, whereas my yogurt has three.  For better digestive and immune system health, eat both yogurt and kefir.  Incorporated into a healthy diet, Dr. Huffnagle recommends one to three, 8 ounce servings of fermented dairy daily.<br /><br />5 Stars","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

The three stories featuring Poe's Parisian detective Auguste Dupin, produced 1841 - 1844, are conveniently collected in this edition that comes with some bonus features not easily found elsewhere as well as suggested questions for book clubs.    The three stories are \\""The Murders in the Rue Morgue,\\"" \\""The Murder of Marie Roget\\"" and \\""The Purloined Letter.\\""  For someone who burned through the Poe canon a few decades ago, the return to reading him in this collection was a fresh pleasure.  He really does lay out the principles and conventions of detective fiction that have been well honored into the 21st century, not only on the page but now the screen as well.  Recent nonfiction books, \\""The Beautiful Cigar Girl,\\"" about the case that inspired \\""Marie Roget,\\"" and \\""The Suspicions of Mr. Whicher\\"" cite Poe's founding contributions to fiction, criminology and the rise of popular \\""detective fever.\\""  Editor Matthew Pearl, author of the novel \\""The Poe Shadow,\\"" offers a so-so critical introduction but outdoes himself in digging up three precursors that may have been among Poe's own reading.  The first is a chapter from Voltaire's \\""Zadig,\\"" featuring a character's observant powers that solve a crime, but this being Voltaire, all that virtue gets him in trouble.  The second is an excerpt from the memoir of Eugene-Francois Vidocq, who was something of a French domestic spy.  The last is a selection from William Leggett's 1829 \\""Tales and Sketches,\\"" a tale of justice vs. truth on the American frontier .  Leggett is visible at best these days as a footnote and only his political writings remain available in print, so kudos to Pearl for finding this.    None of these precursors took the notions of problem solving to the philosophical and psychological depths Poe did.  He really does earn the mantle of genre patriarch.  In the parade of fictional detectives who follow, from Sherlock Holmes to Gil Grissom, you can see the Poe in these stories shining through.","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

What a treat I was in for - not only are the pictures so incredibly detailed, but the story is fascinating.  I couldn't believe this was a children's book....and in reality, it's a book for any age.  It quickly became one of my favorite books as well and I've been an avid reader my whole life reading 1,000's of books.  This book will truly become everyone's favorite.  Thank you Mr. Selznick for creating such a marvelous book and I sincerely hope the story will continue.","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

The lead character is Harry Bosch, the leader of a 3 detective team in the LAPD that is assigned an unusually sensitive case. A well-known civil rights attorney that has successfully sued LAPD over and over again for violations of federal civil rights laws has been murdered on the eve of an especially notorious case against the LAPD. Of course, everyone inside LAPD and out believe that a police officer killed him in a fit of revenge and the city is seething.<br /><br />Set just a few years after the Rodney King riots and the O.J. Simpson murder trial, Los Angeles is racially tense, to say the least. This works well with one of the main themes of the entire series - Harry Bosch's name. Harry's real name is Hieronymus Bosch. If you are not familiar with Hieronymus Bosch let me explain. The real Hieronymus Bosch is a Renaissance painter that painted detailed and fanciful paintings of the torments of hell, including demons, strange creatures and their victims. Connelly often presents Harry Bosch as a man walking among the sites and smells of hell - torture, betrayal, riots and the literal burning of parts of the city in protest are the backdrop of this moody, brooding book.<br /><br />Connelly deftly handles the tricky topic of racial discrimination and issues of black and white in this book. While the case is being worked race tints every aspect of the case - Black vs. White vs. Blue (LAPD) is a frequent topic that is discussed - not overtly but neatly inserted as conversations that flow quite naturally in the context of the story.<br /><br />I heard this book as an audiobook and it was truly a joy to hear Dick Hill's narration. He's done several of Connelly's novels and I've never been disappointed with any that he's narrated. He is as good as it gets.he's narrated. He is as good as it gets.","2008-12-20","2008","Books"

The stickers peel easily from their insert--no crazy twists and turns that cause the stickers to rip as they're pulled up. The insert, in turn, removes easily from the book when empty.  This sticker book is beautifully drawn in complete, though sparse, scenes.  The stickers are scene enhancers that can be placed wherever your child desires (there is no &#34;correct&#34; spot for the stickers indicated with lines, etc.).  The book has its own story that reads much like the other Corduroy books, that can be read again and again once all the stickers placed.  Very nice concept.","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

The Brits so devistated China by forcing opium on them that it took nearly a century for them to recover and then only due to extremely harsh measurses instituted by the Communists. It would be nice to see this as a sad chapter in the history of the Western powers but unfortunately, all you have to do is look at US troops protecting poppy fields in Afghanistan to realize that anything like Christian morality goes right out the door as soon as a Western power has economic or other goals to pursue.

I thought it was an incredible bargain at 50$, now I see it's for sale at 31$...amazing.  The real bargain is the access you receive to the online edition.  With the purchase you get a code whereby you can set up your own online study bible. It has everything the print edition has plus you can add your own notes. It's easy and with so many other online and software commentaries available, cutting and pasting in your own notes is great.    The only knock I have against this edition is that it's very non-commital in its notes. My old Ryrie is unabashedly dispensational, pre-millenial, etc.  I don't always agree with it, but I like it that they make a firm statement rather than using the ESV's tactic of saying, \\""some scholars say...\\""  In the end it's kinda like the Laodicean church in Rev. Seeing that my favorite sem. prof.  T. Schreiner is the N.T. editor I was a little dissappointed (but he was sort of like this in class too... non-commital- yet very humble in his own opinion).","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

A great group of kids attended and although many of them did not know each other, they worked together to create a story.  There were children ranging in age from 4 to 12 years and with Brittany's guidance they were all able to participate and contribute their own 'pieces' to the story.  She used prompts from the workbook that inspired the kids to develop creative and descriptive sentences.  Watching them as their &#34;words&#34; went up on the dry erase board was a nice experience and they felt really proud of their involvement in the collaborative efforts of the group!  All the children remained engaged throughout the 45 minute session and the adjectives, nouns, verbs and phrases they chose to add to the group story were each unique but were woven into a fun and cohesive story.  My son's imagination was sparked and he was inspired to think of different vocabulary to enhance his story.  The illustration component was also very important and each child was proud of their completed project.  Highly recommend this book as a resource!  Go ahead, try it and..... Write Something!","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

The wealthy squire Harold Transome is set to grab the local borough seat on a Radical ticket against the objections of the more deserving, labouring Felix Holt. And they soon become unwitting rivals in another arena, for the heart of the book's real heroine, Esther Lyon, the dissenting minister's daughter. 'Felix Holt' is a rich novel: both political speculation and comedy of manners. It portrays 19th century election processes in their full, colourful detail: corruption, intimidation, vote-buying and all, while leaving room for hope and ultimately painting a fascinating picture of nascent democracy. It is also endowed with George Eliot's subtle dialogue and keen eye for psychological and social nuance.<br /><br />I have only read Middlemarch by the same author. The much thicker and better known work has a wider cast of characters and, with its more slowly-paced plot, it provides a deeper analysis of early Victorian country mores, but it is also a more classical piece of social study. `Felix Holt' is a busier, rowdier novel, yet I found it just as convincing and engaging in its characters and relations. It is entertaining on multiple levels; this is a book that appeals both to readers with a historical interest and to those simply looking for a good intrigue. Highly recommended.","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

And then there's history that's not escapist at all, that brings to mind the struggles of the day.  This is history definitely in the latter category.  The subject of the book may be British imperial history, especially in Ireland and India, but the particulars of that history remind one of all the great debates the world has been having since the Englightenment.  Or, more precisely, all the competing philosophies that people have killed, rioted, and rebelled for throughout most of the world in the last 250 years:  equality vs freedom, economic security vs dynamism, rule by oligarch or by democracy, universal vs limited franchise, imperialism vs national self-determination.  The debate over the aesthetics of the environment are even represented as Schama shows throughout the book, from beginning to end, how political the act of perceiving and traveling through the English countryside has been in the book's years.  But this book, even though it touches on all those issues, isn't detailed enough to provide any conclusive answers to any side of those arguments.  And Schama acknowledges that up front, that this is even more of a collection of personal essays on Britain than a detailed history.  To be sure, you do get an overview of British history up through WWII.  To an American like me, it was nice to see some details about the actual philosophies of Disraeli and Gladstone, that Winston Churchill was not the stereotypical conservative that some Americans imagine him to be, Prince Albert's contribution to Victoria's reign, the controversies of rule in Ireland and India.  Still, I got the sense I was exposed to some elliptical references that only an educated Brit would know.  Like many general histories, though, it left an appetite for learning more details.  But I'm going to be viewing a bibliography so heavy with titles from the 1990s with suspicion.  Especially when I see Schama repeating that hoary feminist myth abouta legal \\""rule of thumb\\"" sanction for husbands to beat their wives.  A running theme is the use of British history from Macauley to Winston Churchill and George Orwell, how their perceptions of what the British past was guided their visions for the future, their notions of what war must preserve.  I said in my review of the preceding volume in the series that Schama calls himself a \\""born-again Whig\\"".  He didn't just mean subscribing, in part, to a great man of history.  (Though you can find that in his portrayal of the great, contradictory Churchill and his defense of the man, warts and all.)  He makes clear he mostly means Macauley's notion of an empire bringing democratic liberalism to the world, teaching its subjects, and then releasing them to become brothers in a common culture.  Schama well-nigh rhapsodizes about this gift of empire at the end.  In some ways, this book reminded me of Niall Ferguson's [[ASIN:0465023290 Empire: The Rise and Demise of the British World Order and the Lessons for Global Power]].  Both attempt to rehabilitate the empire while acknowledging its often emphasized downsides.  Unlike the preceding volume, Schama lists many crimes of the British Empire.  If he doesn't genuflect at the altar of Imperial Guilt, he pauses for several moments of silence.  Unlike Ferguson, he doesn't quite come out and say it was, as a whole, all worth it.  Still, Schama approvingly notes we get lovely Indian novels in English, West Indians in London, and Pakistanis breathing liberty in the Sceptred Isle.  Schama's notion of what it means to be British is not a racial notion.  He explicitly rejects that.  It is what, in American terms, is called a proposition nation.  While I appreciated the details of British history Schama gave me, I don't buy this notion of nationhood, a notion that Schama is so passionate about that he lapses, at book's end, into a brief, uncharacteristic bit of incoherence.  Empires less liberal than Britain seem to have had trouble withdiverse populations.  Mass immigration, democracy, and multiculturalism are as unsustainable a combination in Britain as anywhere else.  And Enoch Powell, deliverer of the infamous 1968 \\""Rivers of Blood\\"" speech against mass immigration, now seems less the paranoid ranter of Schama's description and more of a Cassandra.","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

I do have some criticisms though, the major one being that the episodes about Edeard's  rise to power in Makrathan are far too long and could have been considerably shortened.  Having said that, they do seem to be better written and more focused than before but Edeard's story occupies about 70% of this book and that just seems too much.  By comparison, the length of the Commonwealth part seems just about right in the context of the story so maybe this volume should have been shorter.  Another general criticism applying to all the Commonwealth books is that surely it wouldn't be too hard to provide a cast of characters or something similar at the beginning.  Given that these books only come out every 18 months it's sometimes hard to remember who everyone is.    The Dreaming Void finished with Araminta discovering that she is the second dreamer, Aaron having found Inigo and Edeard being hailed as the water walker.  In this book, among other things, Paula Myo (always one of my favourite Commonwealth characters) follows a line of enquiry that leads to the accelerator faction in the Commonwealth, Justine seeks to get inside the void, Araminta is on the run from the Living Dream people and the Commonwealth navy send exploratory probes against the ships of the Ocisen empire who are planning to destroy the Living Dream ships before they can enter the void.  The Commonwealth parts of the book absolutely sizzle with action and seem far better than in the Dreaming Void but as stated previously, the majority of this book deals with Edeard's continuing story and, although I found this part much less compelling than the Commonwealth episodes, you have to pay attention because there are some clues delivered about the void.  Edeard's adventures did get quite repetitive at times, however, and I sometimesfound myself skipping forward to see how many pages there were until the next Commonwealth interlude started.    Overall though I was quite happy and I think this is a comfortable four star effort.  I hope, however, that there is more of the Commonwealth and less of the void in the final volume.  This series seems to be an attempt to mix hard science fiction and fantasy and that doesn't work well in my opinion (I'm not a big fantasy fan though).  Of course there will no doubt be a revelation in the final book that makes it all fit together better.","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

Here's the problem: The recipes themselves are hit-or-miss. We've tried - and liked - Winter Minestrone with Pesto (made with a budget-minded Spinach-Parsley Pesto that is really pretty good). We're going to try the pesto soon in another recipe in the book, Spinach Pesto Pasta with Chicken. The STRETCHED Meat Loaf and Oven-Fried Drumsticks were just okay. The Simple Chicken Stew and Shipwreck Skillet Dinner were just bad - under-seasoned and boring; the Simple Chicken Stew was just a bland chicken soup with a bunch of flour tortilla strips dumped in to make \\""dumplings.\\"" Only they didn't taste like dumplings, they tasted like soggy flour tortillas.

Given all that, I am still going to buy the book. There are a LOT of recipes to pick and choose from, and like I said, I love the concepts.

Sami Khedar is the only veterinarian in Palestinian regions specializing in zoo animals.  Although he is not the manager, he is the driving force behind the Qalailya  zoo on the left bank of the Jordan river.    Dr. Sami, as he is known, is determined to have a zoo that qualifies by international standards, and he is surprisingly undeterred by having to deal with war, in addition to standard, but exacerbated problems like red tape, competition for government funding,     Sami nurses abandoned infants in his home, with the less than joyous cooperation of his wife.    He builds three museums inside the zoo; he used his taxidermy skills to provide the exhibits for the Natural History Museum.   He seeks assistance and animals from other zoos in the region, and often gets them with the help of other zookeepers and veterinarians who, like Sami, put their profession above politics.    It is also somewhat surprising to read about life in a Palestinian city during the turmoil of Arab-Israeli struggles.   I must say that I never expected one of the projects of the embattled government to be purchasing carnival rides to build a fun fair for the children.    I guess that people struggle to maintain a normal life, and need to be able to convince themselves that their efforts will not be in vain.","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

The plot is pretty involved: Jack, a real 'do-it-yourself' kind of guy when it comes to solving problems for his clients, becomes entangled in a jewelry recovery task, hired by an Indian diplomat.  At the same time, his ex-girlfriend, Gia, asks him to look into the disappearance of her ex-husband's female relative, a rich transplanted British old woman, who lives with her sister in a huge Manhattan mansion.  Somewhat improbably, these two plotlines come together, and what follows is a little over the top, but is still fun to read.  Adding to the mix is Jack being torn between the sister of the Indian diplomat, Kolibati, and Gia (who I was a little tired of -- she whines a lot, and can't decide whether Jack is 'safe' for her and her daughter to be around; she annoyed me, quite frankly).  The extraordinary part of the novel is a group of nightmarish creatures who are eliminating people right and left, and whose connection to all of the events is frightening on many levels (and there's an \\""ick\\"" factor when their origins are revealed).  It's good, and worth reading; Jack is a pretty cool guy...let's hope Gia improves in future stories!","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

My prior opinion on Custer was one of a vain fop.  However, the author brings the the man into light a one of social genius and puckish ego.  If accurate, everyone knows someone like Custer and the author's telling helps the reader step into the book easily.    Presentation of facts and subsequent analysis are, in my opinion, fair and intelligently presented - no one has a time machine, so at some point the reader needs to suspend any argument and just read.     One topic clearly and succinctly addressed is that of treatment of the Native Americans - of course, you'll judge for yourself, but I found the author to be fair and rational, avoiding emotional extremes on such a volatile subject.  Someone with a topical interest in Native American settlement will likely find themselves confident in either their new knowledge or clarified retelling of history.    Because of the easy writing and colorful subject, ATG is recommended as a read to consume in one or compacted sitting.","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

The villagers at first believe a rogue wolf is responsible for some sheep savagings, but when a woman is killed in the same manner, rumors of a werewolf begin to circulate. Soliman, the woman's young adopted son, Watchee, her ancient head shepherd, and Camille, a young musician recruited to drive the sheep lorry, head out in pursuit of a loner who disappears immediately after the murder. When the trio realize they are in over their heads, Camille contacts her old friend Commissaire Jean-Baptiste Adamsberg for assistance. The solution of the mystery is clever and unexpected, but the true charm of this book is the eccentric road trip which brings together four vivid and unique personalities: Soliman creates fables to explain reality, Camille reads The A to Z of Tools for Trade and Craft for relaxation, Watchee lives and breathes sheep, and Adamsberg floats in a cloud of intuition, waiting for the facts to settle into an understandable pattern.<br />[...]","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

This book is no exception to that. I had never heard of the main character in this book, Irena Sendler, so it is great that this book was written about her so that her story is not forgotten.<br /><br />Irena was a Polish citizen who refused to turn a blind eye to what was happening in Poland. Instead of running away from all that happened in the ghetto, she stuck by to help the children. She convinced parents that she could keep their children safe by smuggling them out of the ghetto, bringing them to safety and making sure that their new foster families would get money and food to take care of that extra mouth. She did all that under cover of trying to keep disease and illness from spreading with medicine and vaccines. The guards were so afraid of getting sick, they did not check her bags for a long time. She kept meticulous lists of the names of the children, their parents and who the foster families were so they could be reunited after the war. She was eventually caught but was able to save the lists in jars buried in the ground (Jars of Hope). Irena was an amazing person, even when she was caught she stayed silent, no matter how gruesome the torture (though since this is a children's book it is mostly toned down, but I am guessing that the nazis won't just have whipped her and do not much else).  After the war some of the children were reunited with their parents. The other wonderful thing is that Irena kept in contact with the children she had rescued. This was an amazing story.<br /><br />The illustrations were black and white drawings, showing the darkness of war. As another reviewer said, It was great to see how Irena was drawn, at most times she seemed to be a beacon that lit up the place, the one to bring happiness and light around her. Showing people that there is still hope, that she will help. I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />I received a copy of this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

Now into his 40th season as a broadcaster, Staats is the friendly face and voice on the air, a consummate storyteller who is also savvy enough to know when to keep quiet.<br />Curt Smith, in his 2005 book “Voices of Summer,” ranked Staats 67th in his list of the 101 greatest baseball announcers. If Smith does a rewrite, there’s a good chance Staats moves up a few notches.<br />The preparation and determination Dewayne Staats has displayed throughout his career is magnified in his new book, “Position to Win: A Look at Baseball and Life From the Best Seat in the House.”<br />Collaborating with Staats is award-winning journalist Dave Scheiber, the former St. Petersburg Times writer whose 2008 book he co-authored with NBA referee Bob Delaney (“Covert: My Years Infiltrating the Mob”) is a chilling, riveting piece of journalism.<br />Staats and Scheiber team up in “Position to Win” and produce a smooth, cohesive and engaging book.<br />Staats’ philosophy behind the microphone — and in life — is simple, yet effective. He's not a rah-rah guy like one of his famous broadcasting partners (Harry Caray), but he is definitely not a deadpan, Curt Gowdy type, either.<br />Anyone who has heard Staats’ call of Evan Longoria’s game-winning homer in the final regular-season game of 2011 — when Tampa Bay overcame a 7-0 deficit to beat the New York Yankees in extra innings and clinch a wild-card berth — is a perfect example. Staats had the presence of mind to make the call, show the proper amount of excitement and then go silent, letting the audience soak in the moment.<br />In “Position to Win,” Staats spins stories about his years with the Houston Astros and Gene Elston, his time with Caray doing Chicago Cubs games, and his years partnering with Tony Kubek on Yankees telecasts. Staats also writes about his work on ESPN, and goes into great detail about his 18 years calling Devil Rays/Rays games.<br />Staats also delves into his personal life, doting on his daughters and grandchildren and recounting the painful time when cancer took his first wife, Dee in 2008. That ended a longtime partnership and shows how despite his sorrow, Staats was able to leave his emotions at the door of the broadcast booth.<br />The major thrust of “Position to Win,” is all about preparation and taking advantage of opportunities.Staats has shown an uncanny ability to do both.","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

This book should only be read by individual who never has any exposure to the self-help literature.

I then read the anthology from which these stories  were taken:  'The Marching Morons'.    This book---like Atlas Shrugged---scared me then  because I saw trends occurring in 1960 that if   taken to their logical conclusion would result  in a mind-numbing, degrading world as described  by Kornbluth.      The USA in 2008 is striving to fully imitate  a 'Nation of Morons'---see also:  'The Darwin  Awards.'    Dr. Lynn's book, hopefully, will influence our  nation's leaders; but, realistically, this  book will be buried or expunged by Neo-Luddites,  cursed by the uninformed, and buried under  Political Correctness.    God ordered Adam to be good stewards of all his  creations.  Failure to control ourselves will  turn this beautiful blue marble into a cesspool.    We have the technologies, the trained people  and the resources to make Earth into a Garden  of Eden---even with 8 Billion people!---;but,  for Politically Correct reasons we chose not  to do so.

The wait was worth it.     This book has 2 stories that unfold with 300 years between them. This is a story with maps, treasure, mysterious islands, villains and the wide expanse of the sea, in both the past and the present.     In 1715 Captain Thomasina (Tommy) Farris is the pirate captain of the ship Moon Shadow. She leads a total of 300 men in 3 ships as they stalk the Caribbean for riches that can be had from the other ships that sail the waters. In the course of taking a ship Tommy encounters Avery Shaw, her nemisis, whose ships get there first. Throwing slaves overboard he takes the ship and leaves the slaves to drown. Tommy rescues the slaves and in so doing encounters Rebekah Brown, a strong-willed woman who confuses and flusters Tommy.     In the present day, librarian Emma Boyd searches for the treasure map that belonged to Capt. Tommy Farris. Someone is stealing maps from rare books and Emma is helped by Randi Marx, a private investigator hired by her library, to track down the map. Finding the treasure map will foil the thief's plan and will hopefully keep more maps from being stolen.     Catherine Friend successfully weaves the 2 stories together and yet keep the voices in the 2 stories distinct and separate. There are twists and turns throughout both stories. How she is able to keep them so clearly distinct and yet integrated is a skill that not many authors possess. In addition she drops in some names of other pirates, one of whom is found in another BSB book, which I found quite clever indeed. I wanted to search the internet for these other woman pirates even though this is fiction.     Throughout the book I was cheering both pairs of women, Tommy and Rebekah in 1715, and Emma and Randi in present day. Emma has to searchher heart for the truth she feels. Tommy must do the same. Pirates in 1715 have much in common with pirates in current times. The reader discovers just how much that's true.     This is a romance, an adventure, and a romp. It's tightly written and the author successfully leads the reader on a scavenger hunt. A word of caution; make sure that you set aside some time when you read this book. You won't want to put it down. Bravo Catherine Friend!","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

She discovers a world of dark Fae and evil lords and vampires and that she is a Sidhe-seer, one of the few who can see the Fae and therefore fight them.  For centuries the Fae have not be active and mankind has forgotten them and the Sidhe-seers, but now the Fae are coming back.  In this continuation of the tale in the first book, DARKFEVER, Mac is under the questionable protection of bookstore-owner Jericho Barrons, and they search for the book of powerful dark magic that both her sister and Mac can magically sense.  They still need to contend with the Dark Master, her sister's killer, who is bringing dark Fae into the human world.  V'Lane, the death-by-sex-fae, is still hunting both Mac and the book.  And of course things only get worse from there.<br /><br />As someone who jumped in without reading the first book, I can say that the author made it easy to catch up with the events.  It also helps that while a lot of things happen quickly and constantly--there is a lot of action and developments--the big on-going relationships, plot elements and mysteries aren't revealed much within each book.  If you're looking for answers to everything posed in the first book (or even any romance beyond lots of sexual tension), forget about it.  But so far, the ride is an exciting one and I'm hooked enough to want to continue on to the next book to see what else is in store.","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

Magellan isn't going to let go of Carson so easily, especially not considering some of his twisted secrets.  Where will Carson find herself in this world of good versus evil, mage versus fiend?    What an interesting concept!  Carolyn Jewel takes the conventional paranormal story and spins it on its head to create a new and fascinating mythology.  Carson's origins and the mystery behind her \\""episodes\\"" kept me anxiously glued to the pages, even as parts of the story veered past my personal comfort levels.      The basis for the story is exceptional but it is the characters themselves who make MY WICKED ENEMY so interesting.  The blend of darkness and light, good and evil, in so many of the characters adds a unique element to the storyline. Who can't help but admire Carson as she faces such horrifying realizations about her past and her present?  And Nikodemus, what can I say about Nikodemus other than what a hero!  And oh, the secondary characters... I'll just say I hope we see more of them in future books!    MY WICKED ENEMY is a superb entry into the paranormal genre.  Readers should note that the sexual content is a bit high and there are some scenes that may surpass one's comfort level (I know they did mine).  However, the overall storyline should appeal to most readers of the genre.      COURTESY OF CK2S KWIPS AND KRITIQUES","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

Forester, Master and Commander and the rest by Patrick O'Brian, and even the science fiction variant of the genre, the Honor Harrington blood-and-thunder space opera series by David Weber.  You can read any of these for the sheer enjoyment of the story and the character development; but if you want to really understand what is going on in terms of the history or context, it helps to have a Companion text.    This is essentially a collection of footnotes, explanations, background material, and glossary for the 18 volumes of the Ramage series.  Each book gets its own chapter, with a summary, a description of historical personages that contribute to the story, and an explanation of what was going on at the time, and who was doing what to whom on the oceans and battle fronts of the world.  Since the action takes place between 1796 and 1806, Napoleon, Admiral Nelson, and the fleets of Britain, France, and Spain, not to mention the ravages of pirates and privateers, all appear in these pages.  The amazing thing about this book is that even if you haven't read the series, you can enjoy the Companion - I tested this by reading aloud passages to friends and family.  The author does a good job of making the book accessible, user-friendly, and funny.  One of my favorite parts of the book is the \\""In a Manner of Speaking\\"" inserts for each chapter.  Various words, phrases, and idioms from the books that are still in use today get the historical treatment. Did you know, for instance, that `by and large,' `taken aback,' `Black List,' and `turning a blind eye' all derive from naval talk?  Did you know that `posh,' which is synonymous for upper crust, the best of moneyed society, originates from the abbreviated directions for which staterooms these wealthy personages enjoyed during their ocean voyages: \\""Port(side) Out; Starbord(side) Home\\""?  I love details like these!  Or do you know what, specifically, `the devil' refers to in \\""Between the devil and the deep blue sea\\""?  You will after reading The Ramage Companion.   The Ramage books make for great reading.  They are page-turners to rival James Bond stories for sheer `How is he going to get out of this mess?' innovativeness.  So: if you are interested in naval history, the Napoleonic wars, naval fiction, or tales of honor, courage, romance and high adventure, then the Ramage series, and The Ramage Companion, are well worth getting.","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

Musick.   Eventually as famous in his time as Lindbergh or Rickenbacker, Ed Musick helped establish regular airmail and passenger routes throughout the eastern United States and Caribbean. With Juan Trippe, he pioneered airline service to South America and the islands of the Pacific and was the pilot of PanAm's China Clipper on its legendary 1935 trans-Pacific flight from San Francisco to Manila. It was this flight and the aerial explorations preceding it which finally brought Ed Musick wide public acclaim, putting him on the cover of Time Magazine and earning him the Harmon Trophy as The World's Outstanding Aviator in 1935. William S. Grooch's \\""From Crate to Clipper\\"" is the only print biography of this man Time described as \\""the ablest flying-boat pilot on earth.\\""  The author, William Grooch, was a contemporary and close friend of Ed Musick.  Upon her husband's death, Cleo Musick requested the author write this biography and made available to him Musick's complete files, including photos and log books.  Interviews with family members, boyhood friends and fellow aviators helped make this a very personal biography of its famously reticent subject, \\""that super-careful, monosyllabic antithesis of a grandstand flyer\\""[Time].    This relationship is the book's strength and, to the extent there is one, it's weakness. With many passages written in a Boy's Own style [ \\""Ed edged up to the Farman mechanic. 'Mister, how does a fellow learn to fly?' The mechanic pointed at the single seat.  'You just sit down there and start flyin'.\\""] the book approaches hagiography.  Were it not for credible evidence of some of Ed Musick's undeniable accomplishments--he and his friends, in their teen's, really did hand build their first airplane out of motorcycle parts and bedsheets--it would be difficult to give credence to some of the assertions.  One of these would be that he, as a novice observing the weekly fatal crashes of many renowned and experienced pilots, developed the techniques of spin recovery. Published in 1939, this is another book which is a product of its time. It does not suffer the modern fashion of examining the psychological underpinnings of behavior and there are instances of cultural stereotyping (Japanese \\""hiss\\"", Germans \\""smirk\\"").   Avoiding any suggestion of personal failings on the part of its subject, the book nonetheless presents a very engaging and fascinating portrait of a rare and brave individual.  Best found in library collections (worldcat dot org), this book is strongly recommended to anyone wanting to relive part of the adventure and romance of the golden age of aviation.    As the oceans rise, that lonely monument and its island will, like the men it commemorates, disappear beneath the waves.  Edwin Musick's and their achievements deserve, at least, this memorial.","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

I will state my opinion of the book inested of giving a synopsis like all the other reviews seem to do. I bought this book brand spankin new because I read the great reviews the book got on Amazon.com and I just couldn't wait for it to be shipped... i wanted to read it NOW NOW NOW.     Before I say anything I will state that I am a hardcore romance fan. I am even more a huge fan of erotic novels. So before you read my review and automatically assume im a romance bashing nut understand that Nora Roberts, Lora Leigh and Linda Howard are authors that I read and reread on a regular basis.     Well lets say that this book is incredibly unrealistic. The characters are very underdeveloped, you dont get a sense of actually experiencing what Hannah is goig through because the writing is very skittish. I understand how Hannah could have done some of the things she has done, and Carew's ideas of explaining the reasoning as to why Hannah reacted the way she did makes a lot of sense, only she didnt do such a great job of translating it on paper. J.M. and Grey seem completely fabricated and dont seem like genuine characters. I dont even want to begin to start about Hannah's sister, Grace. Everything about her character is contradictive.     Even the sex scenes, which is the main reason why anyone would pick this book up in the first place, seemed rushed and underdeveloped. I did fall in love with Grey towards the end of the book, but I think the author could have made more of an effort in making him less of a chump and a pushover and explain his decision in the end because in the end i was left with the feeling of \\""oh gosh I would never go out with a guy like that\\"".     The book wasn't totally lost though because I did stay reading it because I was curious of the way the book would develop. But overall I wouldnt have spent the money on the book knowing what i know of it now.     By the way... the ending sex scene in theend was completely and utterly ridiculous, cheesey and tacky. To the point that I actually rolled my eyes about 10 times trying to get through it.","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

This is the story of Middlesex and the 1920 County Championship. Plum Warner, Middlesex's captain, was in his final year, and Middlesex were the Champion County , rising from mediocrity in mid-season with a string of improbable victories. It almost sounds like fiction for young adults, but it's all true. A bookie would have given you very long odds indeed at midseason, and almost equally long odds up through the final matches.     Mason writes very well: you're given fine biographical portraits of those who played for Middlesex. There are excellent decriptions of the matches and their drama. In the match against Yorkshire in mid-August, they needed a victory, and won by 4 runs. At one of the darkest moments for Middlesex, when defeat was looming, one of the Yorkshire crowd yelled out into the silence \\""You're beat, Ploom!\\"" which helped inspire Middlesex to extra effort. They needed to win their final match against Surrey at Lord's: a draw or loss would have given Lancashire the championship. They set Surrey 244 in 3 hours to win on the final day of the match: about 2 1/2 hours sufficed to put Surrey out for a 55-run win. It's a truly great story: you get to know Warner and his style, the players for Middlesex and the other counties. Highly recommended!","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

However, it is a fairly flexible language, which allows for several ways to do the same thing but perhaps one way is definitely better than others; it takes time to learn the best practices.  With PHP, it is easy to produce spaghetti codes if you are not careful, while it is certainly possible to make very solid object-oriented systems as well.  The best way to learn in the end is to read a lot of well-written codes by capable, programmers with experiences, but for a developer who needs to code tons of stuff and has pressure to meet deadlines, time is precious.  That is why this book is useful.    Much of PHP is specially designed for web development, so the book includes a lot of essential topics dealing with web development: XML, security, dealing with form data, i18n and l10n, database, and so on.  In software development, new releases are norm, and some topics discussing actively developed modules do show their ages at times.  However, there are still a lot you can learn from the standard O'Reilly quality book, rather than collecting hodge podge of information available on the web.    If you know some other language already and have read one or two introductory PHP web development book already, this will be the most used book on the shelve about PHP.  This book and the official online documentation gets you quite far.    In my case this has been easily the most used PHP book.","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

In the introduction, Charles Perry points out that the earliest \\""cookbooks\\""  were in Arabic - most cooking was apprenticed from mother to daughter (or from chef to chef) working side-by-side, and therefore there is a real dearth of pre-industrial written recipes, Arabic cooking being an exception.  What I found most interesting (from a historical perspective) was the evolution of Arabic cooking.<br /><br />As the Islamic empire spread out from Arabia in the 7th and 8th century, the conquoring Muslims were exposed to new cultures and, of course, new cusines.  These more sophisticated tastes, in turn, became a part of Middle Eastern cusine as bedouin tastes were synthesized with flavours from throughout the Mediterranean world.  These recipes reflect this, as well as the rich variety in Islamic culture.<br /><br />The first third of the book details this culinary history.  As a historian, I found it fascinating.  The remaining two-thirds of the book are recipies: cold appetizers, bread and broth, sweet-and-sour dishes, roasts and sausages, stews, dairy dishes, soups (a pesonal favourite to date), pasta, sauces and pasteries.  Many of the dishes are not difficult to make, and the ingredients are fairly common - the exoticness is in the combination of flavours, the methods of cooking and the spices used.<br /><br />As a social history, this was a fascinating read - I had not thought that deeply about food and its close associoation with history quite in this way before.  To be able to prepare the foods was an added bonus.  Recommended.","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

The book was written by a remarkably bright, learned, and knowledgeable neuro-scientist who works at Harvard and MIT. The author argues that for centuries we have been assuming that human beings acquired no instincts from their animal forebears, because human nature is formed only by learning, not by our evolutionary heritage, and that this assumption is delusory.  The fact is, he convincingly contends, we inherited a number of instincts from our primate predecessors, including the territorial instinct.  Each animal grouping claims a territory instinctibly, and defends it with their lives.  Every human nation claims a territory, and is fully prepared to defend it with their lives.    Each animal grouping is led by a dominant alpha male.  The same is true of human groupings.  Most corporations, military forces, and nations are headed by alpha males or alpha females.  Mostly males so far. The alphas are those driven by a need to gain top leaership positions.  Some of these leaders care not only about gaining leadership, but also care about the well-being of the people they lead.  Many, however, care only about gaining power and control, and they often wreak havoc in the nations they lead.     We must find a way to profit from the creative drive evident in alphas, and at the same time, of checking their potential for destruction.","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

Among all the biochemical processes going on in the body, the one we have some control over is digestion. This is one book among many that attempts to explain how to exert some control over the digestive process. If we don't pay attention to what we eat and how we digest what we eat, we ignore our responsibility for our own health. The author explains how certain foods require a certain level of stomach acid in order to be fully digested while others require a lower level of acid. It does seem to be true that discomfort (indigestion) most often accompanies a large mix-meal rather than meals where the food groups as depicted in the book are eaten several hours apart.<br /><br />(note: if we do not have the level of stomach acid to fully digest proteins, which requires more acid, the basis of the author's food-group-separation theory, we'll feel bad after we eat; if we then take anti-acids, further reducing or blocking the production of stomach acid, we will, over time, become ill because we won't be absorbing nutrients from our food, because it not only won't be at the correct phase of digestion when it reaches the absorptive section of the gut, but the food particles can cause harm in their undigested and undigestible state. This is explained in other books. Prescriptions for acid-blockers can exacerbate a low-acid condition, leading to serious illness. Many articles available on the internet explain this as well as explaining self-testing to determine whether one's condition is low-acid or not.)<br /><br />Along with other books I have in my library or that I sought out, I found this book to be helpful and especially liked the chart showing what can be eaten together with protein and what should not be eaten with, for instance, breads and grains.","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

This is the world of human beings who have discovered they have magical abilities that set them apart as \\""Others.\\"" Upon discovery of their powers, these Others must swear allegiance to either the Dark or the Light. Agents of the Night Watch (Light others who oversee the nocturnal activities of the Dark Others) and Day Watch (Dark Others who keep watch over the day) work to uphold a treaty, which precariously maintains equilibrium between the Dark and the Light. But now, after a thousand years, the time has come that has been spoken of in an ancient prophecy, that a supreme Other will emerge and threaten the balance of power. When mediocre magician and Night Watch member Anton meets a cursed young woman who is an uninitiated Other, he finds himself at the very center of the struggle, with the fate of the world in his hands.     The characters are well-written and engaging, the story fast-paced and intelligent. And yes, as noted by one reviewer, the concepts (ie, the dichotomy between the Dark and the Light) in this book have been covered before. Of course they have--it is part of the definition of high fantasy. What is particularly compelling is the arbitrariness by which an initiate chooses between the Dark and the Light--the choice can be based on something as trivial as one's mood at the time of initiation. It also makes one question just where the line between \\""good\\"" and \\""evil\\"" actually lies. Beyond that, the possibility of a world existing right beside our own is always intriguing--it's one of the things that makes stories like Harry Potter and the Chronicles of Narnia so appealing--the possibility of stepping outside the mundane into an exciting adventure. Which is exactly what the Night Watch is.","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

Harry W. Smith both wrote and illustrated this detailed book. A talented craftsman/artist in several areas, Mr. Smith is best known these days for his oil paintings, fabric arts, and jewelry creations. But in this book, written in 1984 and revised in 1993, Harry shares his skills with tiny files, lathes, hinges, stamped hardware, hardwoods, and inlays. Tons of B & W illustrations, sections on general themes, plus 18 furniture projects.<br /><br />Mr. Smith covers the selection of woods, working with wood (including joinery), the use of tools, finishing, and even working with metal, before he starts on the main subject. He then begins the projects section with rough, simple pieces and brings you quickly up to speed on more detailed projects.<br /><br />The book does assume a moderate level of ability with tools, a basic knowledge of furniture styles, and some previous work with miniature projects, but the avid amateur can make very good use of this book on their way to becoming a skilled hobbyist or craftsman.<br /><br />One warning... okay, two: Mr. Smith is rather matter-of-fact (nearly dogmatic) about methods and materials. Don't be afraid to stray from his recommendations. Plus, the book is a bit dated, so the section on tools and suppliers is rather stale.<br /><br />That being said, this book still rates five stars for the amount of information, the number of beautiful projects, and the great instructions and illustrations. Just the joinery and inlay techniques in the Federal Period projects makes it worth the original $30 price tag.","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

They’re narrated by Katie Schorr, who has potential but was by no means skilled at the point when she recorded these. I hope she’s gotten better with practice. She reads in a pleasant, engaging manner that draws you in, but she doesn’t use various pitches to identify different characters, doesn’t make her voice husky for Haven or even lower her voice when the males speak, which seriously threw me off, because it all sounded like one character, one speaker, and I never got used to it. I have no idea why she wouldn’t, but it could only have helped. If she can’t voice act, why on earth is she voice acting? (And this is a review of Evermore, but I have to say, she tries a British accent in the second book and It. Is. Awful. Like, comically so. I wanted to giggle whenever she used it.) But with practice and quite a bit more effort, it seems, I believe she could be really good.<br /><br />But she’s not a deal breaker, and not why I’m on the fence about reading further into the series. The writing… It wasn’t the best I’ve read, and it wasn’t the worst, at least as far as style goes. Another case of getting better with practice. The dialogue could have been more varied and personalized to the characters, they all seemed to have the same speech pattern, and for some reason I had a hard time picturing Damen saying the things he did, but that could have just been because he was read as if he were a girl. It was difficult, audibly, to identify who was speaking until his or her name was provided after the quote. It was also difficult to figure out whether Ever was speaking or thinking, likely due to aforementioned factors and the first-person narrative.<br /><br />While the story made me curious enough to listen to book two, it was hardly original or even very intriguing. If you’ve read or watched the Twilight series, you will immediately draw parallels that are so blatant it’s clear this series was written and marketed during the height of the vampire craze, while the films were exploding into a phenomenon. There's even a meadow where they bond. (SPOILERS AHEAD, BEWARE) It appears Ms. Noel thought she was being clever when she led Ever—and us—to think that Damen was a vampire, then—surprise—has Damen laugh at Ever’s suspicions and say vampires don’t exist. To me that meant that Noel was very aware her plot was a Twilight knock-off, and while she might have only been trying to acknowledge it, it came across as mocking. Like, “Haha, I know it’s obvious, but you can’t prove it, cuz there are no vampires! Ha ha!” Thoroughly sick of vampires myself, I was not amused. She seemed to put more effort into directing us toward the false vampire reveal than thinking through what she really had Damen be, because she went straight from little elements of paranormality into full-on other dimensions, quantum physics, and mind-over-matter meditation. She tried to explain paranormality with sci-fi, and while I can see how that might work, she did it in such a slapped-together, afterthought sort of way that it seemed more like made-up excuses than reasonable explanations. (Then in the second book she adds witchcraft, and it all just tumbles into a clusterfug.) Overall, the plot was unoriginal, and she desperately tried to hide that behind crap that didn’t make any fugging sense. (One of the characters uses the euphemism “fug,” so I thought it was appropriate.) Lastly, as to the pace, it was tedious. Too much internal dialogue, not enough action. About two-thirds through I actually cried aloud, “Would something just happen already?! Oh my god, Ever, grow some balls and demand some answers!”<br /><br />Which leads me to the characters. They were all self-involved, insecure, and immature. I get that they were teenagers, but seriously, they were all brats. It was okay with Ever’s little sister Riley, though, because she was twelve and somehow made those traits endearing, and it was okay with the aunt, because she didn’t know how to go from a single workaholic to a parent of a sixteen-year-old, and really made an effort to be a good surrogate mother, shedding those traits in due time.<br /><br />I couldn’t decide if I liked Ever or not, but I’m thinking not. She had no spunk, she had no attitude, she didn’t stick up for herself. She never pulled back her shoulders, straightened her spine, and said enough was enough. Not to her classmates, not to her friends, not to Damen, and especially not to herself. I get why she was all woe-is-me; she suffered a terrible tragedy. But she didn’t make any effort to move on, or even pretend to. She just let her grief, misery, and confusion consume her and drag her down into a well of self-pity she never seemed to climb out of, not even in the sequel. I would bet she remains drowning in that well throughout the series. She was so tolerant, almost indulgent, toward Damen’s antics that I wanted to slap her. And I think she was supposed to be reasonably intelligent, but I didn’t see much evidence of it. She was obtuse, in all honesty.<br /><br />(SPOILERS AHEAD, BEWARE) Oh, and can we just take a minute to acknowledge her weird name, since Noel and the characters never do? Ever Bloom. She’s reincarnated several times. Get it? She blooms over and over again. Subtle as a punch in the face.<br /><br />I really didn’t like Damen. He made no sense, either, as if Noel’s efforts to draw out the intrigue—and the word count—kept her from portraying him as she wanted to. He was supposed to be this lover boy whose unending existence revolved around Ever, but I thought he was extremely anal-retentive and high-handed, dictating the terms of their relationship and dragging her around on a leash, taking advantage of her being star-struck over him to woo her with sappy romantic gestures that robbed him of his testosterone. When they’re finally “together” (if you can call it that because they’re relationship goes so fast and is so poorly developed), he becomes rather absent, described several times as having a far-away, deep-in-thought expression, and about all the information he shares about himself are lies/evasions and declarations of undying love. He’s still a stranger by the end of the book, and doesn’t relate any better in the second. (SPOILERS AHEAD, BEWARE) And I don’t understand why he didn’t try to explain things to her. He wanted to be in a relationship with her, and he knew he’d made her immortal. I think. That wasn’t very well explained, either. But he went so far as to wipe her memory to keep his secret, which would have been a deal breaker for me, if I was still putting up with his unforthcoming crap, were I in Ever’s spot. I’d have put my foot down and told him that if he wasn’t going to share himself with me, I sure as fug wasn’t going to share myself with him. It really bothered me that they were supposed to be soulmates and true loves and want to spend the rest of their lives together and yet there really was no relationship to speak of. Also, he was such a bad influence on her! Cutting school, breaking laws, doing whatever they wanted. And why didn’t he have some sort of honest career? Yeah, the world thought he was seventeen and he would never age (theoretically), which someone might have noticed, but he’d been alive six hundred years! He could have thought of something besides using his abilities to cheat at the races and win a sickening amount of money without hardly lifting a finger. It was mentioned, just once, ex machina, that he had been a model and an artist, neither of which seems like a good idea for someone trying to keep a low profile. I might have had a little more respect for him if he’d been doing something worthwhile. Maybe he had before the timeline of the book, but we don’t know, because he never shared.<br /><br />Anyway. Ever, Haven, and Miles were apparently their own little “loser” clique in school, but I think no one wanted to put up with their moaning and groaning. Haven was an ungrateful bee with an itch who expected people to take her “dibs” on Damen seriously, which is probably the stupidest thing in the entire book, and when Damen showed no interest in her, she still blamed Ever for stealing him away, even though Ever was trying to stay away from him, which is petty and nonsensical. She wasn’t accepted in her family and was always searching for acceptance and acknowledgement from others (she was a serial Anons-meeting crasher), but she took for granted the two people who did accept her and threw their friendship back in their faces, or at least she did with Ever. Miles had SO much potential as a lovable character, I wanted so badly to like him, but he had more of a relationship with his phone and slew of boyfriends than he did with Ever and Haven. I truly believe they’d all have been happier if they’d focused on each other and tried to be a team instead of themselves.<br /><br />So if you're a Twihard, you'll either be enraged by the ripped-off plot or ecstatic for more of the same. If you're not a Twihard, you'll either admire Noel for taking advantage of the current market, like any good businessperson, or you'll despise her for trying to ride the wave. I'll hang on to the next two audiobooks of the series until my library loan expires, in case I'm desperate for reading material. Otherwise, I've had my fill of this series.her with sappy romantic gestures that robbed him of his testosterone.

The Chafetz book was actually brilliant, fair, and honest. McNamara's book was so biased as to verge on fraudulent.    Boston Globe    Author: By Geoffrey Stokes, Special to the Globe   Date: 03/25/1994 Page: 50  Section: LIVING  BOOK REVIEW  BREAKDOWN  Sex, Suicide, and the Harvard Psychiatrist  By Eileen McNamara  Pocket, 289 pp., illustrated, $22    OBSESSION  The Bizarre Relationship Between a Prominent Harvard  Psychiatrist and Her Suicidal Patient  By Gary S. Chafetz and Morris E. Chafetz  Crown, 365 pp., $25    Geoffrey Stokes, who has written extensively on the media,  writes the My Back Pages column for the Sunday Globe book  section.   By now, of course, everybody knows the saga of Paul Lozano and Margaret Bean-Bayog: After a youth that was both troubled and sunny, with loving parents who sexually abused him, Lozano entered Harvard Medical School in the autumn of 1983. At the end of his second year, at which point he was both close to suicide and a strong, well-adjusted student, he began a course of therapy with Dr. Bean-Bayog. Over the next four years, she simultaneously kept him alive through heroic and innovative therapy and so badly mistreated him -- perhaps having an affair with him or at the very least, masturbating in his presence -- that her therapy caused him to regress dramatically. Finally, nine months after their therapy terminated, he killed himself, proving both that she'd done wonders to keep him alive for as long as she had and that her infantalizing treatment had left him incapable of coping with the world.   The malpractice suit and licensure hearing that grew from these events -- and the attendant media coverage -- were influenced by Harvard's disdain for ordinary folk, by bigotry against Mexican-Americans, by working-class distrust of intellectuals and by bigotry against uppity female doctors and were thus both a replay of the Salem witch trials and along overdue tightening of lax supervision of the medical profession. Such wildly contradictory accounts are what one would have to believe if one somehow managed to accept the different facts, opinions and tones of these two books -- one by a Globe reporter, the other by a Globe contributor -- as true. But blanket acceptance of this sort being impossible, a reader has to choose -- and though it might theoretically be possible to select a factoid here, a judgment there, the two present such radically different views that the choice is necessarily all-or-nothing.   This is not easy; though I am somewhat more sympathetic toward Bean-Bayog as a result of these books, I'm not that much more certain about what ''really\\"" happened during Lozano's therapy and life than I was when his vexed case was playing itself out on the front pages. But I am sure of this: One of these books -- McNamara's -- is pervaded by a bias that fatally cripples its argument.   It took me a while to realize this, partly because I've admired McNamara's journalism in the past and was therefore inclined to cut her some slack, but more because her confident, no-nonsense tone and just-the-facts demeanor make her book seem far the more objective of the two. Gary Chafetz's, by contrast (and I'm going to refer to the book as his because its first- person voice and its preface make clear that while his psychiatrist-father, Morris, was an active consultant throughout this project, Gary Chafetz did the writing), offers such a personal take that it at times seems self-indulgent. Is it really necessary for us to know, for instance, that Chafetz was nervous about interviewing an Andover/Harvard/ Harvard Law prosecutor because the lawyer had \\""grown up on the tough streets of Somerville, a blue-collar suburb\\""? Or that Chafetz's own reporting had been honored by Boston Magazine?   The answer, somewhat surprisingly, is more yes than no; though any particular detail might seem silly, their cumulative effect turns out to be reassuring. It took a while -- perhaps two-thirds of the book -- for the strategy to kick in, but I found myself convinced that his was an honest quest for a slippery and difficult truth.   Initially, however, Chafetz seems merely to be dithering, while McNamara -- who as storyteller exhibits a stronger narrative grip on the material -- marches through the case with the unambivalent zest of Sherman cutting a swath through Georgia. Choosing to play a prosecutor's role (Bean-Bayog did not grant her requests for an interview), McNamara makes the Lozanos' malpractice case with all the force she can muster. Hers -- she rather too obviously believes -- is the terrible swift sword of righteousness. And when she deals with such topics as the Commonwealth's shameful indulgence of dangerous doctors, it may well be.   Just as often, though, she's out there with a tire iron. Here, for instance, McNamara tries to twist a sympathetic phone call to Bean-Bayog from Dr. Thomas Gutheil, who would have been one of her expert witnesses, into an act of insensitivity: \\""When this case began leading the evening newscasts, Dr. Gutheil was one of the first to telephone Dr. Bean-Bayog to express his condolences. 'The initial stuff was, I would say, critical to the point of being abusive, and I feel sorry if anybody gets that,' he said, in explaining his call. He placed no similar call to the Lozanos.\\""   Well, no, of course he didn't. He knew and had worked with Bean-Bayog; the Lozanos were strangers. If my friend and a stranger get into an automobile accident, it's to my friend's hospital bed that I go. And McNamara deducts no moral points from the Lozanos -- whose lawyer, after all, had chosen to make the case as public as possible -- because their friends in El Paso didn't commiserate with Bean-Bayog.   The tire iron is actually preferable, however, to the tear-stained hanky McNamara sometimes wields. Dismissing feminist criticism that Bean-Bayog was treated more harshly than similarly situated male therapists, McNamara writes: ''Where were the feminist complaints about the rush to judgment against Epifania Lozano? Where was the righteous indignation about the smearing media that circulated unproven claims against this woman of impeccable reputation? Or did the good name of a Mexican-American housewife carry less weight than that of a Harvard psychiatrist?\\""   There is so much wrong with this typically (alas) sentimental ''argument\\"" that one hardly knows where to begin. For openers, anyone who believes Margaret Bean-Bayog was treated better by the media than Epifania Lozano was spending those months of 1992 on Mars (Quick quiz: Whose first name did you remember before reading this review, Dr. Bean-Bayog's or Mrs. Lozano's?). Second, the charge that Mrs. Lozano had abused her son was made privately, in therapy, and the source for the \\""unproven claims\\"" against both women -- though not of the carefully crafted arguments against Bean-Bayog -- were one and the same: those words of the late Paul Lozano that the family of Epifania Lozano had chosen to make public.   Indeed, the most honest element of this passage is its venom. Throughout, in ways that inform and ultimately undermine her book, McNamara is furious with \\""Harvard\\"" and all its metaphorical and political power. For reasons that doubtless seem to her worthy, McNamara has used poor, sad Paul Lozano and his story to smite her enemies.   Against this, Chafetz's confusions and ambivalence come almost as a relief. In a number of instances, his reporting seems more thorough than McNamara's, and he is good at explaining difficult psychological notions. By the time I'd finished reading his explanation of \\""countertransference,\\"" for instance, I'd understood that Bean-Bayog's much-discussed sexual fantasies might have had some genuine therapeutic purpose (that is to say, to the extent Lozano transferred to her some of the feelings he'd had for other important women in his life, Bean-Bayog's writing down her own reaction to that transference -- so it could be restudied and sifted for clues -- is intellectually defensible). That didn't make reading them any easier -- and I can't shake the visceral feeling that she got into deeper waters than she should have -- but Chafetz's tolerance for ambiguity is more convincing than cruder arguments would have been.   Additionally, he is careful rather than argumentative when trying to explain the overlaps and differences -- and the hostilities -- between psychiatrists who believe that mental illnesses can be managed primarily or exclusively with medication and those who believe more traditional therapy is required. This high-stakes debate is both the battlefield on which the case of Bean-Bayog's license would have been fought and the crossfire in which she got caught. And it was, as he says, much more a matter of \\""Harvard vs. Harvard\\"" than the crowd-pleasing, tabloid version McNamara offers.","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

The batteries on Island#10, which were the most significant threat to Union ships, were surrendered once gunboats passed the island thus enabling thousands of Union troops to safely cross the river below the island, thereby flanking it (the island was not heavily garrisoned and defensed only facing the river).<br /><br />Like Fort Henry on the Tennessee River and Fort Donelson on the Cumberland, the batteries on and around Island #10 presented the Confederate forces their most forward (and most substantial) defensive position on the Mississippi River (Columbus, KY was initially, but was abandoned without a fight once the position was turned by Grant's Army).  What is also notable about this battle was that this defensive position had more heavy canon that even Vicksburg subsequently had.  Furthermore, this siege/battle provided valuable lessons for the Union that were incorporated in subsequent ones, notably Vicksburg, e.g., understanding that ironclads could effectively run past heavy shore batteries, the limitations of mortars, and the effective application of joint Navy/Army operations.  The defeat created panic and had negative effects on morale in the South, and highlighted the shortcomings of static river defenses as the predominant Confederate strategy to block Union use of the river to ferry troops and supplies, and keeping it open for its own use.  Finally, this defeat resulted in at least 4,000 confederate forces captured with no more than 25 total casualties for the Union, as well as the loss of dozens of Confederate artillery pieces.  No Union gunboats were lost.<br /><br />This book is well-researched, structured, and easy to read and comprehend.  The paperback is also larger thannormal, and so is the text.

One would hope that wisdom would trump years of golf played, but not so much.  This is a maddening game that I punish myself with at least 4 times a week.  Perhaps it is that one perfect shot in each round that keeps me coming back.  As a beginner, it did not take me long to figure out that the secret to taking strokes off the game is to learn a good short game and too putt well and with confidence.  I am a natural at the putting but until I read and have reread many times, David Peltz \\""Short Game Bible\\"", I really did not understand the many subtle ways the short game is played.  It did not take me long to figure out that the score was made within 67 yards of the green, but what club to use and how to use it was a continual frustration.  Although his formula will work for someone who has played a long time or has hours to practice the short game, I just needed insight on how this part of the game is different.  Understanding the concept of the finesse swing and still hands has helped me come a long way in a short time.  Getting adrenaline under control and staying calm are as important to the perfect chip and pitch as club selection.  I know this because I have an evil sand wedge that does not know how to get the ball out of the bunkers and a buried lie is an instant unplayable lie still.  The book is not an easy read and must be consulted almost after each round when I freeze over the ball and try to remember what I am suppose to do and which club to do it with; a review of the book at this time is a good reinforcement.  One thing about golf, unlike other sports, is the course is different and plays different with each round because you seldom end up in the same place on a course played on a regular basis.  Knowing the short game principles as laid out in this book has helped a beginner like me.

The Dog Master follows two human tribes and a small wolf pack in Ice Age Eurasia as they struggle for survival.  The Wolfen strive to live as much like wolves as possible and regularly pay tribute to a wolf pack they follow.  The Kindred settle in northern caves for the summer and travel south for the winter.  Both tribes face challenges from the weather, food scarcity, and a terrifyingly brutal tribe they call the Cohort.  Each tribe has strict rules and hierarchies to help them survive the harsh life of Ice Age humans.  One human defies a tribe’s ruling and sets into motion the events that would lead to a wolf becoming a dog.  The Ice Age story is bracketed by that of a contemporary professor who has a breakthrough while trying to learn everything possible about the first wolf to become a pet.  Although the professor appears only in a handful of pages, he is a fascinating character.<br /><br />The story of how the tribes arrange their lives is a story of intrigue and political machinations among and between early humans.  All of the human characters are real, complicated, and fully-drawn. More importantly, the story features some wonderful wolf characters.  W. Bruce Cameron has a way of getting into a dog’s head (or a wolf’s head) and telling the reader what might be going on in there without being overly sentimental.  He also has keen insight on how human packs work and has some good guesses on how we managed to get some wolves to join us and become dogs.","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

The novel is set up with three parts per chapter: the \\""main story\\"" (as narrated by the established secondary character, who apparently learned English mostly from a thesaurus), the \\""other story\\"" (by the author/title character, discussing his ancestral history of the past few hundred years, sex-lives and all), and a series of letters from the secondary character to the main character.    Many people found the English-as-a-second-language narration of the \\""main story\\"" grating or even offensive, but this is ridiculous. It adds a truly alien aspect to the character, and some of what appear to be oddities in his speech are actually improvements on daily speech, upon second glance. Also, the masterful slaughter of the English language is  strangely reminiscent of Nadsat (the slang in \\""A Clockwork Orange\\"", for those unfamiliar). And please note: this novel was, in fact, WRITTEN AND RELEASED BEFORE THE MOVIE \\""BORAT.\\"" People love to claim that this novel is ripping off Borat's style of speech. Even if \\""Borat\\"" came first, the styles are hardly comparable.    The \\""other story\\"" contains many sexually graphic depictions, but none of them seem overdone or unnecessary. The world set up by Foer in the semi-fictional Ukrainian town of Trachimbrod is very unique, creative, and captivating. Many scenes, concepts, and stories from this section stick very hard with the reader, due to their collective strange, beautiful, and occasionally disturbing aesthetic. This may have been the most interesting part of the book, although its omission from the movie is very understandable.    Additionally, the letter series serves as a sort of epilogue that runs through the entire story.    Overall, this book is a great read. I will admit, however, there is a possibility that my opinion is slightly biased, due to my personal interest in the Slavic and Jewish cultures (both ubiquitous throughout the novel), as well as the fact that the singer of a band I listen to costarred in the film adaptation. I reasonably doubt this, though.  Anyway, I would suggest this novel to anyone looking for a dark, funny, and somewhat experimental story. If interested, one should definitely read the novel before seeing the movie. However, in my opinion, both forms of the story are amazing.","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

What I like about this book, is that the case laid out for the reader is based off of facts and loopholes found in the documents of Abraham Lincoln's assassination that are kept in the National Archives. There are many written testimonies, in their original form shown in pictures, throughout the book. Some of them are so worn and/or blurry that it's hard to read them and I don't know if it's just that way in the advance reader copy that I received and it will be better for the actual release or not, but even then, many of them are also easily legible for the reader.<br /><br />Author Robert Arnold makes some startling points about people that were involved in the assassination of Abe and those who aided in John Wilkes Booth's escape. There is no question that Booth killed Lincoln, but some of the facts that Arnold unearths in this book are truly shocking. The most jaw dropping findings to me that he shows you, without question,  implements Secretary of War Edwin Stanton in his role of helping with the assassination. There are too many situations that he shows you through the facts of the case for him to have not been involved in it.<br /><br />The information in this book that lays out the case that John Wilkes Booth was in fact never killed, but rather another man was murdered in his place and told to the public that it was Booth who died in a barn shoot out a few weeks after Lincoln's assassination is very intriguing. There is  very plausible evidence that suggests that Booth lived all the way into the 1900's under assumed names and this book tells it all!<br /><br />This book will make you reconsider everything you thought you knew about the Lincoln assassination. Some of the points in the book maynot sway you, but others (most) will undoubtedly show you that there were definitely some conspiratorial scenarios going on during this tragic event. Robert Arnold thoroughly did his research for this book; it's one that I couldn't put down and would highly recommend to anyone who is fascinated by anything to do with Abraham Lincoln. I easily give this book 5/5!","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

I listened to the audio version of this book and Victor Slezak does an amazing job bringing the fabulously written story to life.  I checked this out of the library, but this is definetly one that I will be purchasing as I found myself relistening to the book once I finished it.      The story starts off a little slow, but by the time I got to the 3rd of the 14 CDs in this set, I realized that I wouldn't be able to put it down until it was finished.  The story is absolutely gripping and very suspensful.  Just when you think you have something figured out, a surprise is right around the corner to change your mind.  It really keeps you guessing.  The book has many themes (but not in a distracting sort of way).  Murder, deceit, friendship, bitterness, revenge, jealousy/ENVY, love.    At the center of this story is Parker Evans.  I have to say, he is one of the most vividly drawn characters that I can recall.   He's very direct, intelligent, somewhat lewd at times, but had an underlying vulnerability and sweetness to him that makes him an irresistable and very memorable character...and he's also downright sexy  He's also in a wheelchair, but you hardly notice it.    Much of this story is written from a male point of view (and believably so), so some of the language and themes are a little crude at times. Had it been done different, I don't think it would have worked as well.      Be sure to start this book when you have time to spare as you may have trouble putting it down like I did....It's in my list of top 10 books.  I absolutely LOVED it and have already relistened to the book and will probably do so again multiple times in the future.","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

In the early years of the 21st century, he had somehow fixated on the idea that he should follow in the footsteps of a former Telegraph reporter -- 19th century explorer and colonialist Henry Stanley (he of \\""Dr Livingstone, I presume\\"" fame) -- and travel overland and on water the length of the Congo river, thousands of miles to the point where this massive river finally reaches the Atlantic.<br /><br />Easier said than done. To start with, there is the fact that for the last half century or so, Congo is a country that people try to get out of rather than into. (At one point, a resident of Kisangani tries to persuade Butcher to take his four-year-old son back with him to South Africa, because there is no future for him there.) Aid workers and diplomats thankfully leave the day their postings expire, while members of the UN mission (the longest-running of its kind) exist in tiny airconditioned enclaves in the equatorial jungle and similarly count down the days. Almost the only non-Congolese who seem to enjoy life in the country are those who have come to exploit its mineral assets -- cobalt, diamonds and gold, among other products. They, as Butcher shows, live in protected compounds in Kinshasa.<br /><br />Indeed, it's that legacy of \\""asset stripping\\"" -- which Stanley helped ignite -- that Butcher chronicles as he somehow manages to battle his way from one community to the next along his pathway. From the Arab slave traders who raided from Zanzibar in the East to the horrific Belgian colonial regime (read [[ASIN:0618001905 King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa]] for more of that ugly saga), and later to the excesses of Mobutu, Congo's post-colonial dictator, the scores of tribes that collectively make up what we know as the Congo have had little chance to prosper from the growth in global wealth. On the contrary, as Butcher shows repeatedly and eloquently, with every year that has passed since the first eruption of post-colonial war in the 1960s, they have less and less contact with the rest of the world. Jungles have taken over hospitals that once were leaders in tropical medicine and grown over railroad tracks so completely that it is impossible to see where they once led. Highways have become tracks that barely accomodate bicycles laden with mountainous loads of palm oil, that vendors will push for a 600 km, six-week long round trip in exchange for a $50 profit. Only imported ornamental plants show where once the comfortable villas of the Belgians once stood.<br /><br />Indeed, the value of Butcher's adventorous yarn (and it's so suspenseful, it's almost impossible to put down) is to show us what happens to people that the rest of the world exploits and then ignores. The plight of the Congolese is worse than if Stanley had never mapped the Congo in his famous expedition; today, any vestiges of a rule of law (whether colonial or tribal) has vanished and anarchy rules. Even subsistence has become nearly impossible. Butcher notes the absence of animal sounds from the jungle canopy; there aren't enough animals in the jungle to satisfy the need for meat and protein, however, and the staple diet of Cassava leaves the Congolese emaciated, he notes.<br /><br />The story of this starvation and abandonment of any hope; of the violence lurking just around the next bend in the river or the jungle pathway; should serve as just as much of a call to arms as did the famous reports of Morel and Casement a century ago. (Their denunciations of Belgian King Leopold's horrific regime led to public pressure forcing him to turn over what had been his personal fiefdom to the country as a formal colony.) Everyone Butcher encounters is stunned that hehas been able to cover the terrain he has. \\""It took me a while to convince him I was not lying,\\"" he says of one such meeting. In some cases, the reader can detect, lurking just beneath the surface, a sense of astonishment at what they may view as a self-indulgent Western journalist embarking on some esoteric historical project at a time of such chaos.<br /><br />Thankfully, Butcher himself is alert to the danger that his white face may mean for the aid workers and locals who help him along his way. In one town, he is ushered out even before daylight, as the priest who shelters him for a few hours tells him that the mai-mai (or armed gangs) will learn of his presence. And with this book, and its moving look at the life of a country that is actually reversing the course of progress, he has, in my opinion, transformed what may have started as just a foolhardy and self-centered expedition into something more valuable. With the publication of this book, there is no excuse for the horrors of today's Congo to continue to go unnoticed in the global community.has. \\""It took me a while to convince him I was not lying,\\"" he says of one such meeting.

She has made a pact with Elizabeth, helping Elizabeth to the throne and to survive threats while drawing power to build her dark mirror Court and make herself Queen of all the fae in England.<br /><br />A strong narrative thread is nearly absent in the first part of the book where the pact is set up, but the rest is seemingly composed of vignettes going back and forth in time and from the point of view of various characters, which sets the scene somewhat, but more confusingly than otherwise.  But two main characters eventually emerge:  Lune, once a fae in Invidiana's favor, but recently cast out due to arranging a treaty the Queen found unsatisfactory.  She has to negotiate the treacherous court and find her way back to favor or literally risk death.  The other is Michael Deven, who is also trying to make his way, but in the slightly less lethal Court of Elizabeth.  The glimpses into the positions and courtlife is rich in historical detail (I enjoyed reading about it, anyway).  However, I was still missing a strong plot thread and greater character development.<br /><br />Fortunately, things pick up towards the end, when the two courtiers of the two courts come together to solve a threat to both the fae and the humans that touch on both of the Courts and the Queens.<br /><br />Flashbacks and scenes with minor characters conintue, sometimes adding to the tale, but also still diluting any pacing and emotional attachment to the characters, but less so than in the first part. Quite a bit of action takes place off-screen.  I didn't quite feel that the eerie darkness of the fae court was as well realized as it could have been, and there was also some lack of magic in depiction of Elizabeth's court.<br /><br />Although Lune's desperate attempts to make her way through the pitfalls of the Onyx Hall created enough sympathy and suspense, Lune herself, as many other upper-class fae, I suppose, remained cool and next-to-heartless.  Deven, more human, still didn't reveal much character until the end.<br /><br />Both Elizabethan England and the Courts of Faery are well-trodden in the fantasy genre, so perhaps my expectations are higher than they ought to be.  This was still a good book with a fascinating take on Faerie and its denizens, and the depiction of Elizabeth's court was also intriguing--so that the bits and pieces left me wanting more.  The writing was good, I just would have prefered perhaps a little different handling and a bit more actually being shown.  It was still an enjoyable read.as many other upper-class fae, I suppose, remained cool and next-to-heartless.  Deven, more human, still didn't reveal much character until the end.

The Scourge of God is apparently the Prophet, a religious madman working out of Wyoming and the upper midwest. Ok, I can deal with that. But why do his minions, the Seekers, talk in bold type and are almost impossible to kill? Why is Rudi getting visions? For that matter, this whole quest they are on to the East coast is taking on more and more the trappings of The Lord of the Rings. And as another reviewer noted, it's probably going to take them at least two more books to get to Nantucket. And then 4 more to get back?

That practice is not without its peril in the face of the overbearing Najdi cultural uniformity imposed by the house of Saud.  For it means denying in often subtle ways official nationalistic doctrines in a state not known for its tolerance of diversity.  That the Hijaz is the birthplace of Islam and its prophet shields the Hijazi elite, the `awa'il (prominent families), some of whom can rightly claim descent from the Prophet or his companions, from some of the censure that other segments of Saudi society could face when asserting their own regional identities.  Nevertheless it does not entirely remove them from the scrutiny of the religious police and other elements of official enforcement.    The author sets about cataloguing the techniques employed by these prominent Hijazi families to affirm their unique identities as placing them apart from their Najdi cousins, whom they tend to regard as something of uncouth bumpkins next to their venerable, urbane cosmopolitanism.  As she observes, this is practised in some of the most basic aspects and activities of human existence.  Things like manner of dress; habits of eating and entertaining; rituals surrounding birth, death, and marriage; and the observance of festivities in the religious calendar are all invested with significance for the Hijazi identity.  As such they may attract the attention of the authorities, who on one hand are anxious to minimize regional differences but who on the other wish to cultivate the favour of Hijazi notables precisely for their sophistication in education, commerce, and technical skill.    This is an engaging book for all of its being somewhat naïve in its execution, arising perhaps out of the author's origins among the self same people as those she is examining.It thus falls into that genre of anthropological writing and inquiry performed by natives of the societies under study.  There is nothing at all wrong with this.  True to one of the characteristics of that genre, it tends to favour description over theory.  Given the present state of anthropological theory--if such it may be called now--as it has devolved over the last generation, this may be a good thing.  Toward the end of the work, the author makes a few attempts at aligning her work with some current fashions when she speaks of the gendering of Hijazi society, but she is not clear about what she means by that or how she views it.  Indeed, this itself tends to be a bit of a gendered work as such, inasmuch as the author dwells somewhat more on the distaff side of Hijazi elite society.  This too reflects her own origins, as it were, and is not necessarily to be lamented.","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

A friend told me about her first book. I was so impressed that it compelled me to read her second one about the repatriation of U.S. citizens of Mexican descent. I was excited for her third book. It does not disappoint.  &#34;Denial, Confrontation, Obsession and Return&#34; is a collection of four plays that have heavy psychological undertones. The first play, &#34;A Family in Denial&#34; deals with the psychological effects of a dysfunctional home life on two children. Your heart will break for what these young girls have to endure.  The second play, &#34;A Tale of Three Selfies&#34; observes the interactions of four college students who live together. Three of the students have  personality disorders. The fourth member of the apartment is a graduate student doing a field study. Unbeknownst to her three roommates, they are the subject of her field study. Although you may feel pity for the three coeds, you cannot help but enjoy reading about their problems.  The third play, &#34;Together for Eternity&#34; is my personal favorite. It uses the art work of the great Spanish artist, Francisco de Goya, as a backdrop to the story of young woman's unhealthy attachment to her father. Can the aspiring young artist keep her father all to herself?  The final play, &#34;A Return to the Beginning&#34;, is intense. A woman's search for peace in her soul results in a very sad tale about a mother daughter relationship.  I am going to recommend this book to my colleagues in the psychology department. You do not need a  degree in psychology to understand and appreciate these plays, but I think it would be a valuable resource for them to use each play to explain a particular psychological disorder.","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

This book continues Robert Glover's story. Robert longs to help his countrymen fight the Confederates, but he promised his father that he wouldn't become a solider until his eighteenth birthday. Shortly before that time, he accepts a mission of mercy to locate his cousin, Col. Albert Mitchell, a Confederate soldier held captive in a Union prison, and deliver items from the man's daughter. Afterwards, Robert plans to travel south to find his mother and cousin Emily and take them to the safety of his family's farm in the North. But Robert's plans misfire from the start. His efforts to help Col. Mitchell backfire, and he is taken captive by escaped prisoners. Will he ever see his family or home again?<br /><br />I HAVE SEEN HIM IN THE WATCHFIRES is the fast-paced story of a naïve, good-hearted youth who stumbles into a quagmire of trouble. Robert's fortitude is tested both physically and emotionally, as is his faith in all he believes in. While this is a stand-alone book, there are many references to the first book in this series, and readers will have a fuller understanding if you read William Henry is a Fine Name first. Readers are sure to be quickly engaged in I HAVE SEEN HIM IN THE WATCHFIRES--a story of growing up, true friendship, faith in God, and love of country, family and friends. It wouldn't surprise me if author Cathy Gohlke won another Christy for this book.","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

Follow one man's journey through the dark depths of the soul as he struggles with the untimely death of his young daughter, the depression and drug addiction that follow, and most ominously, the threat of something otherworldly encroaching on his increasingly fragile sanity....<br /> In reading this novel, it quickly becomes apparent that Mr. Eads is a seasoned and talented storyteller. Characterizations are strong, memorable, and convincing; and the plot, like a sharp steel hook through the cheek, pulls us ever deeper into the shadowlands, where crushing depression and the supernatural blur in a potent amalgam deftly handled by the author.<br /> Scenes of action and sustained emotional intensity are especially well handled by Mr. Eads, giving Cracked Sky an adrenaline-soaked edge not to be found in many tales. One almost cannot help but think of leading horror novelists like Stephen King when being expertly navigated through such gripping scenes and scanarios. While there's no doubt the author will continue to become an ever better novelist, it is already very apparent in Cracked Sky that he has what it takes.<br /> Ben Eads can write.<br /> Cracked Sky is highly recommended to anyone who enjoys an action-packed tale of mystery and horror, nicely seasoned with generous doses of the bizarre and the grotesque. It's easy to get pleasantly lost in the labyrith of this insane tale of death, the uncanny, and revenge. But don't worry!—<br /> Ben Eads will lead you to the other side.<br />  And he'll entertain the hell out of you along the way.","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

I have missed them for a couple of years.      Being a Patricia Cornwell fan, it was about time.  I had read one of her short stories and they just don't compare to the Scarpetta series.  It takes me awhile to get into the book because there are so many twists and turns in the beginning, but once you sink your teeth into you can't put it down.    It took me about a week to read the book, but it was well worth it.  I find that this is the type of book that you need to read totally uninterupted (no dog/kids, etc) around.  Once I am distracted, I have to go back into the book and find out what happed prior to where I am.    As a senior citizen, it is agreat brain teaser because you must follow the story line twists.    I just loved the book and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes mysteries and great writing.     the forensic part of it tends to be extremely graphic.  This book is not for the faint of heart although it is quite juicy when you get there.  I couldn't put it down.

I've read a lot of Jim's books and have come to expect a lot from him. I must say, this book is his best yet.<br /><br />The book begins with a short 30 page review of network architectures. This review makes for a nice refresher before diving into the 802.1X information. However, unlike many books that attempt to meet a publisher page count by reviewing information the reader should know for 40-50 percent of the book, Implementing 802.1X Security Solutions leaves the refreshers here in the first chapter and spends the remaining 8 chapters and Appendix truly covering the named topic of the book. In all, more than 200 pages are dedicated to the topics related to 802.1X security solutions.<br /><br />The Appendix coverage of EAP is welcomed and provides enough information to understand its operations and how to select the best EAP solution for your implementation.<br /><br />I would give this book 10 stars on a 10 star rating system.

He has accomplished amazing feats that I had no idea were possible.  His advice on how his mindset can be applicable to my and most people's lives is somewhere between irritating and insulting.  Macy is extraordinarily hard-working, smart, and organized; he's also extraordinarily lucky and fails to adequately cite that as a major reason for his success.  For the past three years while he has been training, his wife, his mother, and his mother-in-law have raised his two young children.  In the &#34;Be a Wannabe&#34; chapter, he has a chart of people he admires and why.  His wife and children are lumped into one &#34;person&#34; category.  Throughout the book he mentions the great love and admiration he has for his father, an endurance athlete for decades.  He briefly mentions his mom at the beginning and the end who, despite significant chronic health problems, raised him and his siblings and is now helping to raise her grandchildren (so he can train).  So many people make his life possible, but by far the ones who get the most ink are other endurance athletes.  He has charts throughout the book about how the reader can apply his principles to their lives.  For example, in the &#34;What and Why&#34; chapter, he talks about how you need to think of a &#34;Why&#34; when engaging in drudgery such as housework.  How much housework and child-rearing does he do?  In another chapter he talks about giving up on his goal of becoming a high school principal - at which EVERYONE said he would do a spectacular job - because that was a goal based on fear (of not earning enough money to pay the bills) with his current teaching job.  He then encourages others to not be afraid to back away from similar goals based on fear.  Someone has to grow his food, make his clothes, build his house, test his tap water to make sure it meets standards, educate his children (including an over-time working principal to lead that school), pave his town's roads, stock the grocery store shelves, serve him drinks on the planes he flies all over the world to participate in endurance events.  I'm pretty sure most of them have plenty of days in which their jobs are very stressful or dull and probably not what they want to do for the rest of their lives.  They should all quit!  They're simply acting out of fear of not paying the bills.  Everyone should write a book, and we should all buy each other's books.  Macy and his fellow endurance athletes could change the world with their intelligence, fitness, and savvy - work on educational reform, criminal justice reform, environmental issues.  Instead, as far as I can tell, all of his &#34;mental training&#34; is meant to get him through yet another race, not to do anything for anyone else.  Overall, a rather disheartening read.","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

It is set in the present and at the end of time.  And that end is much further than predicted.  The city at the end of time exists more than a trillion years in the future.    In this novel, Jeremy (Jack) Rohmer is a busker currently living in Seattle.  He juggles mice and hammers on street corners and rides his bicycle throughout the city. He dreams of Kalpa, a city at the end of time.    Virginia (Ginnie) Carol is eighteen years old.  She is fleeing the people in a gray Mercedes.  She also dreams of Kalpa.     Daniel Patrick Iremonk is a scholar of physics.  Like Jack and Ginnie, he is a fate shifter -- capable of wrenching his mind between timelines -- but he does not dream of Kalpa.  Always before, he has arrived in a new timeline within another version of his own self, but this time he resides in the body of someone else.    Conan Arthur Bidewell is a twelve hundred and fifty-three year old collector of written material.  Lately he has been collecting books.  Not popular books, but odd and erroneous editions of obscure manuscripts.  He has been tracking the termination of time through the errors within the volumes.    Max Glaucous is a Chancer, able to change the fall of cards and dice.  He is also a collector of dreamers for the Chalk Princess.  Today, he is stalking Chandler -- another collector -- and his partner, who are working within Max's territory.  Max intends to dispose of his competitors.    Jebrassy is a breed -- a protoplasmic entity -- living within Kalpa.  His kind is relatively new, only a million years or so since their creation by the higher entities.  Jebrassy is very curious and strongly aware of his own ignorance.    Tiadba is a glow -- a breed female -- who is determined to become a marcher.  She takes Jebrassy to meet her fellow marchers.  When they meet the leader of the group, Jebrassy is surprised to recognize her as a sama from whom he has asked questions.    In this story, Ginnie finds a place to stay in Seattle in a warehouse owned by Bidewell.  The warehouse is stuffed with over three hundred thousand volumes.  She does some of the physical labor of moving around the cartons and other such jobs.  But Ginnie is also reading books selected by Bidewell to train her in his techniques.    Ginnie spends most of her time in the warehouse, for she has already had one brush with Chandler and his partner and knows they were lately in the neighborhood.  But she does take one trip to the Busker Jam, where she sees Jack for the first time.    Jack has not had any brushes with the collectors.  His biggest problem is getting people to remember him.  If he didn't move around objects in the apartment, his room mate would advertise for a new roomer.    Both Jebrassy and Tiadba are occasionally possessed by the dreamers.  Jack and Ginnie take over part or all their minds while dreaming.  Ginnie has learned more about Tiadba than has Jack about Jebrassy, probably because she sometimes sits behind Tiadba's mind and observes.    Jebrassy and Tiadba are slated to march through the Chaos to find the lost city of Nataraja.  Two persons had gone to the city in the far past and only they can save the Kalpa.  Yet Jebrassy is taken by the Tall Ones and cannot leave with the others.    Max tracks down Jack, stuffs him in a bag, and takes him to meet the Chalk Princess.  But fate intervenes.  Penelope -- Max's partner -- is carried away by a freak tornado and the van is flipped.  Jack gets away and flees to Bidewell's warehouse.    Daniel also has a close call.  Other collectors surround him and force him into the rundown house where he has been staying.  Only the appearance of Max enables him to escape the other collectors.    This tale involves the collapse of this timeline between its creation and its terminus.  Both the past and the future close into the present.  Elsewhen, Kalpa is being overrun by the Typhon Chaos.    This story invokes some exotic speculativephysics to explain the plot.  Of course, some of the background is sheer imagination.  Apparently humans and their descendants -- and something called the Shen -- have greatly extended the universe, but Typhon Chaos is threatening to undo everything.  Enjoy!    Highly recommended for Bear fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of speculative physics, human evolution, and a touch of romance.    -Arthur W. Jordin","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

Once the warden shows up, it might be more difficult.<br /><br />Harry Dresden is still not-so-hot on the trail of a supernatural murderer and a straying husband, in the second part of Jim Butcher's stellar graphic novel \\""Storm Front.\\"" Butcher's snappy dialogue and murky plot keep this issue going at a steady clip, even as Harry's situation gets even nastier than it already was.<br /><br />Harry summons the fairy Toot-Toot to help him out with the Victor Sells mystery -- and is immediately confronted by a perpetually POed Morgan, who reveals that he believes Harry is the one doing the murders. Fistfight ensues. Cue flashback of Harry's ghastly youth, and the reason that he's now under the Doom of Damocles. And if he can't solve the crime, the White Council will assume hedunnit. Lovely.<br /><br />Since the clock is ticking for Murphy as well, she gives Harry a lead on Bianca, vampiric Red Court madam of the Velvet Room. Unfortunately Bianca is not just a charming bloodsucker. Since she also thinks Harry killed one of her prostitutes, she's more than willing to rip his throat out -- and reveal her true form in the process.<br /><br />Having established the groundwork in the first part, the second chunk of \\""The Dresden Files: Storm Front\\"" is a lot smoother than its predecessor. It's less choppy, more action-oriented, introduces a nasty vampire and some cute honey-loving fairies, and Butcher introduces three of his more memorable characters with nary a ripple in the storyline.<br /><br />In fact, the main flaw with this is that it goes by way too fast, and Harry is still working on finding a solid clue rather than nebulous leads. But it whips by smoothly and quickly with enough action to keep things interesting. And they manage to cram Harry's relevant backstory into a one-page description of how he came to kill his master, and the giant-staff-up-their-butts response from the White Council.<br /><br />And the adaptation preserves Butcher's solid dialogue (\\""Release me or I will tell the Queen!\\"" \\""Toot, if I don't release you, you can't tell the queen\\"") and Harry's wry inner musings (\\""I felt like a real superhero -- Harry Dresden, breaker of monsters' hearts\\"").<br /><br />This issue also introduces some of Butcher's more memorable characters -- particularly Bob, a lecherous spirit residing in a skull who provides some witty banter with Harry (\\""Most men have better things to do in the middle fo the night than play with their chemistry sets\\""). Additionally there's the warden Morgan, who believes Harry capable of anything, and the feisty little Toot-Toot the fairy.<br /><br />And Ardian Syaf's shadowy, colourful, detailed artwork makes a nice complement to Butcher's story, and he doesn't go overboard on the beautiful women in skimpy attire either. He does an excellent job with the hulking, stormy-faced Morgan and Toot Toot, a muscular little pixie with spiky purple hair and a little kilt made out of leaves and berries. He'd be cute if he weren't so feisty.<br /><br />The second part of \\""The Dresden Files: Storm Front\\"" is a smoother ride than the first, and provides more glimpses into Jim Butcher's magical world. And it definitely leaves you wanting more.lid dialogue (\\""Release me or I will tell the Queen!\\"" \\""Toot, if I don't release you, you can't tell the queen\\"") and Harry's wry inner musings (\\""I felt like a real superhero -- Harry Dresden, breaker of monsters' hearts\\"").

With its 'Don't Be Evil' mantra, countless employee benefits and constant experimental beta programs, it appears they are digitizing the world's information through the funnel of one big mysterious algorithm. While reading Planet Google I was constantly reminded of ways in which Google has affected my life. I used Google maps on a daily basis as a delivery driver in Orlando, I used the satellite imagery to see how close a house was to the ocean before renting it and five of my books are available through the Google Books program. My latest novel was researched largely through the Google search engine, my videos are on YouTube and I have a Gmail account that gets checked daily. This intertwining usage made it all the more fascinating to find out where these programs began. However, this apparent loyalty does not color my opinions. As a book Planet Google has much to be desired.<br /><br />While author Randall Stross gives a snapshot of the company and its many ambitions, he does so from a distance. I can only imagine that he had very little contact with the owners or engineers that keep Google ticking. His descriptions are dispassionately technical but meant for the lay person thus failing on both fronts. Further, the human side of the story is missing entirely.

Chercover is the real deal, an author who has made it to the top of my must read list in only two novels.  He masterfully builds his characters and makes you care about them.  He is adept at painting word pictures of Chicago so vivid that you think you are there at times.  His plotting is tight, concise, and engrossing.  Checover creates a Chicago noir with dialogue both spot on and believable.<br /><br />Ray Dudgeon is still recovering from the physical and emotional injuries he suffered in \\""Big City, Bad Blood\\"" when he reluctantly accepts a case from Isaac Richmond, a retired Army colonel, who questions the official version of his daughter Joan's death, an apparent murder by a crazed fellow worker, Steven Zhang, who later commits suicide.  Richmond was not close to his daughter as she grew up and now seems to want to know more about the details of her murder.<br /><br />Dudgeon begins nosing around and soon finds himself and his friends and family threatened by a shadowy organization.  There is a lot of cloak and dagger stuff here with government cover ups, unscrupulous defense contractors, and shadowy agents working outside the government yet protected by its umbrella.<br /><br />Even Ray's friends, FBI special Agent Holborn, and Lt. Mike Angelo of the CPD, are hampered in efforts to work with Ray.  Terry Green, his reporter friend and muse, is back to help Ray think through issues and to provide the psychological support he needs to get through his self doubts.  Adding to the drama is the fact that Ray is still hopelessly in love with Jill Browning, his former love who is trying to move on in her life without Ray because of her dislike for his risky work.  The interactions between these two star-crossed lovers are fascinatingly real and gripping.<br /><br />This novel will not disappoint as it is well written, fast paced, and filled with intriguing characters.  There is an abundance of violence, deceit, lies, double crosses, and heart break.  The reader is led into questions of national security versus individual rights, evil posing as good, goodness corrupted by evil, and the role of the individual in a nation influenced by the military/industrial complex.  Few who Ray meets in this story are completely who or what they seem to be; indeed, the suspense builds as the reader flows with the relentless pacing of this novel and begins to uncover the truth of who everyone is and what their individual motives are. I highly recommend this novel as well as the work of Sean Chercover.is an abundance of violence, deceit, lies, double crosses, and heart break.

The author doesn't challenge the reader with many ponderous questions and perhaps the subject doesn't either. Roosevelt is a straightforward dude (he's even called a 'dude' in some places, leading me to be surprised they used such language in the 1800's).<br /><br />What I liked most about this book is the inspirational character himself. Roosevelt was a stand-up guy who almost always did (or tried to do) the right thing. The fact that he was often successful just highlights his moral qualities. His failures too - and there were many - make him simultaneously more human and relatable.<br /><br />As a 38 year old writing this review I found myself thinking: I don't think we've ever had a truly GREAT president in my life time. Without getting political, I know Reagan and Clinton and Obama have their admirers...but were any of them truly inspirational characters? Personally I haven't felt it. Roosevelt makes you FEEL the inspirational quality.<br /><br />Not just his moral character, which was very strong, but his numerous actions, and the way he lived his life, and the things he did, whether you agree with them or not (such as killing for sport), was very inspirational. I found myself wondering about other past presidents I know little about and how I'd like to learn more about their lives too, especially George Washington who is such a revered (and yet unknown) president.<br /><br />You do learn a bit about some past presidents in this book as well including Grover Cleveland and William McKinley and Benjamin Harrison. Harrison was the worst of the three, although Cleveland wasn't much better (although he seems to have been very clever). McKinley was probably the best president of the three, but certainly not a stellar figure. The book doesn't talk at all about Roosevelt as president (hence, 'the rise of'), so we don't get to learn about what he actually did as the boss man in this massive tome. So that was a bit of a disappointment, but certainly not a reflection on the quality of the book itself.<br /><br />The book is VERY detailed and sometimes I found myself getting a bit bored with some of the details of passing legislation as Roosevelt the assemblyman, and those kinds of things, but you can skim the book in parts and still get a very vivid idea of the man. Honestly I didn't skim as much of the book as I could have just because it was mostly so interesting to me, but it would certainly be possible if you wanted to save time.<br /><br />I recommend this book if you want to learn about one of the truly great Americans that ever lived. If you want to be inspired to live your life to the fullest and to maximize your potential, well this book is a detailed examination of how to make that happen - more so than any self-help guide on the matter in my opinion.ually did as the boss man in this massive tome.

Needless to say, I'm anxious to get started on 'Temptation of the Warrior'.

I'd love to read more about the home land of Brogan and the circumstances that lead up to the desperate quest to seek the brigha-stone. Just a suggestion, but perhaps a spin off series dedicated to the magical world of Coruain. I'd definitely be an instant fan!

I made the mistake of taking it hunting with me thinking \\""Oh, a book that will keep me thinking about hunting so I won't get too distracted...\\"" Well actually, this book did the exact opposite. It almost made me miss a deer.    But as for the book itself, it isn't just some collection of hunting successes and failures. It's Chapman's own opinion on how morals and lessons learned through hunting are incorporated into every hunter's life. It is beautifully written and the illustrations included at the beginning of each of the chapters are not only appropriate, but they also serve as reminders of good and bad times to hunters (I certainly remember looking at a few of those pictures and thinking \\""Hey, I've been in that situation before too... good times...\\"").    Chapman has done an excellent job on this book. If you have an appreciation for hunting that goes beyond the simplicity of just going out into the wilderness to shoot things, and an equally strong appreciation for your religion (The bible is quoted throughout the book for those who would like to know, but there is no in-depth interpretation of it. He isn't trying to promote religion, just show how his love for hunting and his religion go hand-in-hand), then I highly recommend that you read this book.    I lent the book to a friend so I don't have it with me as I write this review to quote it properly, but I do have an idea about how my favorite line in the book goes. It was something along the lines of making the most of your life before \\""life comes up behind you, taps you on the shoulder, and tells you the hunt is over.\\"" This quote goes with a short story told earlier in the chapter, but it still has a powerful meaning behind it nonetheless.    So as mentioned before, if this sounds at all interesting to you, go ahead and get the book. This is one story you'll never regret reading.","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

The teamwork produced interesting results. For example, an illustration of Pocahontas is juxtaposed against an actual early photograph of the Jamestown River. Illustrations of a string of pearls, which Powhatan gave to Pocahantas for her wedding, a settler's house, and a picture of Thomas Rolfe, son of Pocahontas, are shown against bright green pages.<br /><br />Pocahontas is first. After mingling with early settlers, Pocahontas, Chief Powhatan's favorite child out of twenty-seven, was abducted to prevent further strife between natives and settlers. She eventually married a white settler and had a child.

From the first part of his little book, I give the page number of each of his statements, and then either quote it with possible elisions, or else (as indicated by parentheses) summarize it.  My responses follow after a double dash.    p.  8 \\""Religion has made a comeback [recently]\\""--Is that surprising?  People always revert to basics when times are difficult.  Similarly, there has been a swing back from liberalism in American politics to conservatism in the same period, for the same reason.    p.  17 \\""[Dawkins'] is not the Christian definition of faith.\\""--It is his observation of those of faith.  \\""Watch what they do, not what they say.\\""    p.  20 [Responding to \\""Faith is infantile\\""] \\""I did not believe in God until I started going to university...  Anthony Flew ..  started to believe in God in his eighties.\\""--Is there no reversion to infantile behavior in adulthood?  Is Flew perhaps getting senile?  Political conversions occur in adulthood, and some are clearly seeking a parent figure.    p.  21 (Atheists might force their doctrine into children's minds if they were in control.) --Yes, all human beings can be dogmatic.    p.  21 (Dawkins knows very little Christian theology.) --How much is worth learning, since it is all unsubstantiated opinion?  He knows and quotes the basic Christian dogmata--virgin birth, resurrection, transsubstantiation.  Isn't that enough?    p.  23 \\""..endless recycling of outdated arguments..\\""--Maybe they were true then, and they are still true, but faithheads don't want to listen.    p.  23 (On Dawkins quoting Martin Luther \\""Reason is the enemy of Christianity\\"")  You seem to interpret Luther's use of \\""reason\\"" pretty far from its apparent meaning.    p.  24-5 (On Dawkins' destruction of Paley's 1801 pseudo-scientific arguments for God's existence) --You are right to approve.  It was just another attempt by a desperate Christian apologist.  What made it any different from all the other apologies?    p.  25-6 (On Dawkins' rough handling of Thomas Aquinas) --You say yourself that Thomas assumes God's existence (p.  26).  Why then does he bother to bolster its plausibility if it is so obvious?  You say they are \\""persuasion, not proof\\"".  Can you pronounce the word \\""casuistry\\""?    p.  26 \\""Darwin's is presently the best explanation..  but that doesn't mean it is correct.\\""--You utterly fail to apply probabilities here.  Many of our daily beliefs have probabilities far below that of Darwin's and other scientific theories.  The latter are not 100% certain, maybe only 80-90%, but that's still plenty good enough to depend upon.  As Dawkins clearly points out, religious faith has a very low percentage of likelihood.  He specifically puts himself into a category of being 99.9% (but not 100%!) certain of God's non-existence.    p.  27 \\""The natural sciences ..  quest for the 'grand unified theory' which itself does not demand an explanation.\\"" --??  Science cannot find the ultimate cause of anything.  It merely seeks wider and wider theories which do explain observable phenomena, and hopefully with simpler and more elegant explanations.  E.g.  instead of epicycles upon epicycles to explain the herky-jerk apparent motion of the planets, gravity is a single simple theory which explains their orbits cleanly.  What the ultimate cause of gravity is still a hot topic among physicists.    p.  28 (On the anthropic principle) \\""We may be highly improbable--yet we are here.\\""--The winning gambler says the same thing, and then deduces a supernatural reason for his winning.  But what do all the losing gamblers say?    p.  29 (On Dawkins' destruction of Paley's proof of \\""God is in the gaps [of science]) \\""It was a foolish move.\\""--Yes, it was foolish, as foolish as every attempt of religion to explain the natural world by supernaturalism; the classic example is the Church vs. Galileo.      p.  30 \\""While ..  some exotic forms of Christian theology\\"" [discourage investigation] \\""it is not characteristic.\\"" --So why don't mainstream theologians dispute those exotic ones? They're rather silent about them.    p.  30 (McGrath does not support Intelligent Design) --Bravo.    p.  31 (Swinburne posits that science cannot explain how explanation by the human mind works, and that God is the \\""most economical and reliable account\\"".) -- Here we go again.  Anything a faithhead does not understand, he immediately imputes to God.    p.  34 (Quotes Gould & Rees, eminent scientists, that some ultimate questions \\""lie beyond science\\"".) --So they do, at least for now.  That does not give you the right to claim that God must be the only possible answer.  The true age of the earth was a mystery until radioactivity was discovered, in 1900.  Science advances, and time will tell.    p.  35 \\""There can be no question of scientific 'proof' of ultimate questions.  Either we cannot answer them or we must answer them on grounds other than the sciences.\\""--You cannot defer an answer?  You cannot wait?

Please don't use \\""religious\\"" in a positive sense without clarifying which meaning you intend.    p.  63-66 [Criticizes Dawkins for stating, but not proving with the use of science, many of his claims] --Suddenly, a defender of religion becomes an advocate of the scientific method?    p.  70 [Many \\""worldviews\\"" cannot be proved, like religion or politics, but that does not prevent people from believing in them.] --Political and economic ideas can be tested for their utility; supernatural ideas cannot.    p.  73 [Quotes Dawkins writing \\""Memes can sometimes ..\\"" and then castigates him for making a \\""creedal statement\\"".] --Dawkins does say \\""sometimes\\"", and he is always open to new scientific evidence.    p.  78 \\""In their efforts to enforce their atheist ideology, the Soviet authorities ..destroyed ..the vast majority of churches and priests..\\""--The Soviet regime was totalitarian, true enough, but it was religious in all but name:  it had a nonrational creed (the proletariat must and will rule), infallible holy scriptures (the works of Marx, Lenin, & Stalin), canonized saints (the embalmed Lenin and Stalin), and belief in a supernatural overwatcher (\\""History\\"").  Their destruction of enemy religious apparatuus was no different from that of Islam's behavior toward Hindu and Buddhist structures in India and Afghanistan, Spanish Catholic destruction of American Indian religions, or American Protestant destruction of \\""heathen\\"" rongo-rongo books on Easter Island.

The media has not changed and misinformation abounds then just as it does now.  The author herself has also lived a traumatic life, and it is to her credit that she cared for her father in his final days and was afforded the opportunity to spend time with him.  My heartfelt condolences for all of her losses.<br /><br />Secondly, I agree that Mr. Gravitt did not receive a fair trial in any way.  I have often wondered why there was never any mention of the Marshes being charged with jay-walking.  Mr. Gravitt was fortunate that those with whom he worked believed in him and kept a job waiting for him when he was released from prison.  He was not as fortunate with his dealings with the media and the public's perception.  The rest of Ms. Moulder's theory, however - that John Marsh &#34;plotted&#34; from the first time he met Miss Mitchell to use her and then later decided to murder her - leaves me dumbfounded.  If for no other reason than it makes perfect sense that if you are in the middle of the street and see an oncoming car, you are going to move in the opposite direction you think that car will go.  Unfortunately for the Marshes and Mr. Gravitt, they both went in the same direction.<br /><br />In the author's preface, she states &#34;I'm not a literary professional nor do I claim to be proficient in spelling and grammar.  I just have a story to tell and I hope there are people out there [who] can overlook my lack of writing expertise...&#34;  Ms. Moulder would have benefitted greatly from an editor or proofreader as the text is rife with errors, but at least she admits as such up front.  All of which is ironic considering how much she condemns Margaret Mitchell's lack of education, inability to get her work published and inability to type, as well as condemning John Marsh for editing and proofreading his wife's articles for the Atlanta Journal and her entire Gone With The Wind manuscript.<br /><br />The most glaring omissions, though, are her lack of citations for her sources within her text (i.e., footnotes) and thus the evidence she needs to support her (conspiracy) theory that John Marsh murdered his wife.  Which is, again, ironic considering how much she condemns the prosecution lawyers for making up evidence that got her father convicted and the defense lawyers who would not present adequate evidence to get him acquitted.  Between her inability to write and her outlandish theories about Margaret Mitchell's and John Marsh's relationship, she unfortunately comes across as lacking any credibility at all.<br /><br />I had to treat her book as a literal translation of an oral history because it is written as a total stream of consciousness.  I started out reading it with a pencil because it was often times difficult to follow her train of thought.  I eventually gave up on even that, however, because her accusations of John Marsh having set out to murder Margaret Mitchell were just too ridiculous to even bother with my 'reader's editing'.  I know Ms. Moulder did not intend to write any sort of biography, but if you want to read credible information about Margaret Mitchell (and better analyses and interpretations of her letters, his letters, her family's letters and interviews with those who knew the Mitchell and Marsh families), seek out Marianne Walker's &#34;Margaret Mitchell and John Marsh, The Love Story Behind Gone With the Wind&#34;, which is excellent, or Pyron's &#34;Southern Daughter,&#34; which is also good (but long on psychological analysis).  Both are well written, thoroughly researched and cited accordingly.  Ms. Moulder cites them in her bibliography but does not seem to have read them; or, if she did, she cherry-picked what she felt would prove her theory.<br /><br />It is truly a travestyof justice what happened to Hugh Gravitt.  He really was at the wrong place at the wrong time.  And it is unfortunate he was wrongly convicted, and that he lived out the remainder of his life being hounded by the press and the public.  (Again, ironically, not unlike Margaret Mitchell herself.)  If nothing else, I hope this book serves to exonerate Mr. Gravitt.  Unfortunately, Ms. Moulder's ramblings and far-fetched theory that Marsh murdered his wife will probably obscure that.lly was at the wrong place at the wrong time.

The pagan Greek Plato called what they said “noble lies.” The Jewish Maimonides named them “essential truths.” The Moslem Ibn Tufayl gave the lies no name, but wrote a book describing why it is necessary to hide the truth.  The Roman Plutarch hid the truth in his famed history “Parallel Lives,” and gave an idealized version the ancient heroes “with the intention of conveying moral examples to imitate or avoid.”  They knew that the lies they taught the masses were not facts, but teachings that advance what they considered to be good, what we could call “pedagogical truths,” focusing on education, or “orphaned truths,” unrelated to real truths, or “pious myths.”<br /><br />As many other philosophers, Maimonides recognized that intelligent people, leaders, clergy, philosophers, and teachers of all kinds need to teach people lies – such as, God spoke to prophets, you will be resurrected, pray and God will help you, this is what God demands, God will punish you unless you do this, there will be a messianic time when all evil will cease – to make people feel good about themselves, feel secure, “know” that there will be a better time, behave properly, provide stability, preserve order, and teach and promote values. Maimonides told readers of his Guide that he will place both his true ideas and “essential truths” in his Guide so that the common people will find notions in it that support their beliefs while intelligent people will be able to sift the true teachings from the dross.<br /><br />Even the Bible seemed to sanction lies. Abraham told his servants and his son Isaac that he and Isaac will return from offering a sacrifice while he had every intention when he said this that he would offer Isaac as a sacrifice to God. Jacob misled his father Isaac claiming he was Esau the son that blind Isaac wanted to bless. Moses attempted to persuade Pharaoh to let the Israelites leave Egypt saying they would return after three days. The biblical book Chronicles suppressed the truth contained in the earlier biblical books; they retold the earlier-told tales in a manner that erased mistakes made by biblical heroes, such as King David’s adultery and murder of Bathsheba’s husband. The Chronicle version is “actually far from a detached recording of what happened in the past.”  And there are many more examples of dishonesty in the Bible. Abraham ibn Ezra states: “Our sages explained this beautifully, for ‘a prudent man conceals shame.’”<br /><br />The Talmud recognized a concept halakhah ve’ein morin ken, meaning that although something is technically permitted, the rabbis do not inform the masses of the leniency out of fear that using this permission could have negative ramifications. Nachmanides (1194-1270) contends that this concept is in the Torah which states “It is the glory of God to conceal a thing,”<br /><br />The rabbis lied and continue to lie for many reasons, such as the interest of peace, to stop people from sinning, to avoid embarrassment, to prevent injury, to collect money to support the study of Torah, to help feed a poor man, to improve a person’s chance of marriage, when one has a mental reservation that what he is saying is not true,  for educational reasons, and if the lie leads to a good result. Each of these reasons is subjective; one rabbi may feel that the lie is appropriate while another might strongly disagree. It is as if the rabbi is saying, I can lie if I think it is proper to do so and if I feel that it is better for the person to believe my lie rather than know the truth.<br /><br />Marc B. Shapiro  points this out and shows how this phenomenon continued from ancient time to righteous Jews today, including famed rabbis who lie to other Jews. His book is superb, scholarly, comprehensible, well-documented with copious supportive notes, very readable, and above all eye-opening. He shows that all too many rabbis in the Orthodox community rewrite the past by snipping out of books of prior rabbis and scholars, even well-respected ones, that which does not fit into their personal world-view. They “insist on viewing the past through the religious needs of the present,” erasing the liberal opinions of the past to obligate others to follow their personal notions of what is right. Organizations such as ArtScroll distort the interpretations of Bible commentators in their ArtScroll commentaries when what is said contradicts their understanding, as they deleted the “offending view” of Rashi’s grandson Rashbam on Genesis 1:5 that in the Bible the day began in the morning. These rabbis are turn their backs to what is true when they are convinced that what was said would lead readers to observances they dislike. Paradoxically, rabbis who make these changes consider themselves traditional, even hereidi, ultra-Orthodox, men who decry the changes wrought by the Reform movement; yet they too are uncomfortable with the past, the history of Judaism and its practices, and feel the need the revise what is most sacred to them, what the Torah actually says and Judaism.<br /><br />They conceal the conviction of many sages that parts of the Five Books of Moses” were composed after Moses’ death, such as Abraham ibn Ezra and the famed pietistic Rabbi Judah HeHasid who held this post-Mosaic view. They hide the fact that the codifier Moses Isserles felt that it is permissible to drink non-Jewish wine. They censored Joseph Karo’s “Shulchan Arukh” where he states that the “kapporot” ceremony on the day before Yom Kippur in which people transferred their sins to a chicken was a “foolish custom.” They erased the opinion of Rabbi Hayim of Volozhin quoting the Vilna Gaon “that in matters of halakhah one should not give up one’s independent judgment, even if that means opposing a ruling in the “Shulchan Aruch.” They excised the statement of Rabbi Joseph Messas (1892-1974) from his “Mayim Chayim” where he ruled that married women have no obligation to cover their hair, a decision also held by Rabbi Joseph Hayim (1832-1909) and many others. They conceal the ancient decisions by respected rabbis such as Rabbenu Tam, Rabbi Solomon Ganzfred in his “Kitsur Shulchan Arukh,” and others that the “shekiah,” sunset for the purposes of when the Sabbath starts, takes place much later than what is usually regarded as sunset, that the Shabbat begins when it is dark about an hour after the current practice. They obscured the ruling of the highly respected codifier Rabbi Yehiel Mikhel Epstein (1829-1908) that one is allowed to turn on electric lights on festivals. They expunged the opinion of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch that everyone does not need to devote his life to Torah study and the opinion of Maimonides in his Introduction to his opus “Mishneh Torah” that Jews need not study the Talmud. They erased the Vilna Gaon’s belief that it is only a custom for males to cover their heads and that in Orthodox families in Germany, male Jews only covered their heads when at prayer or saying a blessing. They painted head coverings on the pictures of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson, and many others who did not wear a head covering in college. They hide that Rabbi Kook, the first Chief Rabbi of Palestine as well as Maimonides taught that people need to exercise.<br /><br />Also, hereidi Jews as well as rabbis who are afraid to deviate from them will not mention the words breast, gay, homosexual, rape, or insert the words in their newspapers, and even exclude pictures of women, including that of Hillary Clinton, even though this is not prohibited in the Torah and was not the practice in ancient Judaism.<br /><br />These are just some of the many examples that Dr. Shapiro gives in his excellent book (with a couple that I added) of how rabbis and others have changed and are continuing to change the immutable Torah.<br /><br />We could, of course add many more to the couple of hundred example offered by Dr. Shapiro, for Dr. Shapiro notes that he is not giving a complete list of violations. For example, many rabbis today do not reveal that the behaviors they are advocating in their sermons is not taught in the Torah. Also, when these rabbis sermonize today and base their sermons on the “fact” that the “medrish” says such and such, the rabbis do not reveal that there are multiple Midrashim, each saying something somewhat different than the others, and the position they are advocating is not held by other Midrashim.They excised the statement of Rabbi Joseph Messas (1892-1974) from his “Mayim Chayim” where he ruled that married women have no obligation to cover their hair, a decision also held by Rabbi Joseph Hayim (1832-1909) and many others.

I'm not a fan of medical dramas, but it would be unfair to pigeonhole The Cancer Ward as strictly a medical drama. It is much more an exploration of the lives of the different men who inhabit a 1950's era Soviet oncology ward. The men come from a mix of cultural, ethnic, and social-status backgrounds, and at times the author does use them to advantage for commentary on elements in Soviet life, but Solzhenitzen never allows the social commentary to overpower his handling of the characters. He is a cancer survivor too, and he draws heavily from his own experience. The book is at its best when showing how cancer recasts one's priorities, particularly the last several chapters, which follow Oleg after his discharge from the cancer ward. It is here that Solzhenitsen so artistically renders the world transformed through the eyes of a cancer patient.   This book is not like Gulag Archipellago, but is wonderful in its own, much more personal way. The fact that Solzhenitsyn produced both of these works is a testiment to his craftmanship as both a storyteller and a first-person historian.","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

Not everything in either storyline was resolved in a rosy way for Lieselotte or her mother which made the book more representative of real life.  There was more than one surprise in the book.

DDT was another important advance - inventor won the Nobel prize in medicine.<br /><br />An earlier eradication effort produced dramatic reductions in some areas, but progress largely ended with a loss of funding, a ban on DDT (cotton farmers' overuse being the major problem), and never really got going in Africa.<br /><br />DDT is now used again for spraying home interiors.<br /><br />A vaccine is the best hope for controlling malaria - one is now being tried.","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

So, the book actually is telling people that how you look superfiscially to others determines how beautiful you are.    From here the book discusses and infers that you should dress up your face and body to get as close to the golden rule of beauty. The theory is that if you and others think your superfiscial appearance are beautiful, you are!...and that your self-esteem will rise because of it. No doubt there are studies about attraction that back up these claims, but one's sense of self-esteem should not be dependent on how attractive you are to others! Good grief! We teach children to not be so superfiscial!    Anyway, aside from this flaw and several other minor flaws, this book is a great book about how to be healthy...and about how increasing one's health increases one's beauty. Now that I can agree with. No doubt that if you are healthier, you won't be too fat or too skinny...your skin, hair, teeth, and eyes will be glowing, flowing, white, and clear. You will have more energy, less stress, live longer, etc. Now that (as the book gets around to saying) is the kind of beauty you should want to attain...for that is real beauty...and that will attract the 'right' kind of partner (a healthy-minded, good soul).","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

Reading &#34;Wondering&#34;  made me realise just how at times  the heart cannot fully &#34;understand&#34; and how understanding might not always &#34;has a heart&#34;  but when combined as if into a magical potion, it  sustains, enriches and ultimately rewards. During the darkest of days, with the sky filled with clouds, the Reader knows that behind these clouds, the sky is always blue. Although the path to such clarity comes at a price, as we learn, the rewards proove infinitely worth the personal sacrifices.The creative approaches to mediate the seemingly relentless, unassailable pain and suffering offer insight into our own imaginative ways when all else seems futile. An Uplifting and inspirational personal account  we wish never  have to experience ourselves. In face of such bravery, we feel like cheering for this committed couple from page one straight  to the very end. Intimate describing of personal lives enduring a wide range of challenges that culminate in triumphant ending elevates the Reader along the way into recognising the value of maintaining a positive attitude coupled with oftentimes intuitive stick-to-itiveness.

I enjoyed it. It was an interesting plot, well-written, and suspenseful. The main character is a weirdo, even if he's important to the plot. I had hoped Lucas was a clone, but he wasn't. I did get a feeling of satisfaction from the creative explanation for his identity. A repetitious \\""Humpty Dumpty\\"" quote gets annoying, and then it resolves nicely.     It seems the more you observe, the less you participate. This story is an extreme example of a man trying to observe the world without being involved in it. Instead his face ends up in the paper, and the law and 20 killers are looking for him.     I liked the line, \\""People look, but they don't see. People hear, but they don't feel.\\"" There are a lot of thought-provoking ideas, although a few are more creepy than anything. I'm not asking for preachy, but I was anticipating more of a Christian message than this book offered.     I found myself making comparisons with Dekker. (Couldn't help it.) Hines, a new author to me, handles violence more tastefully than Dekker. I can handle suspenseful scenes, but Dekker's last two books I read triggered disgust. Call me a wuss, but I don't consider nausea entertaining. The ending of The Unseen gets pretty violent, but without much blood or grisly details. The very very ending is a modern version of riding off into the sunset - driving out of state with a brand new set of identification. Comparisons aside, this author is no copycat. He did his research and wrote a bizarre, entertaining novel about a subculture I'd never heard of, and one that hopefully doesn't really exist.","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

This book explores the issues in education.<br /><br />Clearly, it took a lot of courage to write a book like this when one reads through it and can imagine what fellow tutors might feel who do not necessarily share your own point of view in the educational world.<br /><br />The two Professors, Kathryn Ecclestone and Dennis Hayes, have produced a important work on educational policy and thinking here which, in my view, is much needed by giving some balance to the current debate on the future of education and the type of people we are producing for this first generation of 21st century.<br /><br />So what is this `therapeutic education'?<br /><br />There is no one single definition from the authors but let's has a go- they write that:<br /><br />`Therapy was once regarded as a cure or treatment for people who were disturbed or troubled or mentally ill.'<br /><br />They continue `now the term has changed its meaning and become a positive value'. This is where I come into the discussion, reading the work as part of my PGCE studies and being genuinely affected by it because it covers much of what has concerned me about what is happening in education in the early part of this century.<br /><br />Continuing their theme over 8 chapters looking at different areas, the first introductory chapter is entitled \\""In an emotional state\\"". Here, the authors examine \\""how the government has come to sponsor therapeutic education as part of New Labour's approach to `social justice'\\"" offering \\""examples of popular concern about emotional well-being and the therapeutic orthodoxies that underpin and reinforce this interest\\"".<br /><br />The authors then show a political evolution from ideas about conferring esteem on a vulnerable public to the more active promotion of `the means to be happy', and they summarise how their arguments have led to a new role for education.<br /><br />For me, this book then became a critique of what the `New' Labour government has done to the UK with its policies embracing `therapy' in all its guises since 1997, and I agree with most of what the authors have written, having viewed the effects of therapeutic education directly in further education colleges and at university (chapters 4 and 5) as a teacher in recent years and as Counsel in the courts.<br /><br />Many readers of this book will know that it is no secret that much of what we teach today does not meet the requirements of our society and, frankly, much of the blame can be laid at the feet of this `therapeutic education' experiment which has failed with serious consequences for society. That is the strength of this book.<br /><br />There are well argued conclusions to each of the main chapter headings, but the most important is left to the end, in chapter 8, entitled \\""a response to our critics\\"".<br /><br />I said Ecclestone and Hayes have been brave when looking at this `new curriculum of the self' which is how I would describe therapeutic education and therapeutic approaches to knowledge which (they say) instills \\""the idea that the pursuit of knowledge, once a liberating ideal, is inherently emotionally unsettling and even damaging\\"" if such approaches are used.<br /><br />Yes, they are correct and I gained original knowledge of it whilst completing my PGCE.<br /><br />One sub heading is \\""There are a lot of damaged people out there\\""! The authors look at the state of suffering and their comments made me think immediately of the previous generation to mine whose lives had been transformed by world war but had got on with it, as ex-servicemen like me do today. I came away with the view that there is a strong need for balance, but that balance has shifted the wrong way and the reasons have been identified by the authors.<br /><br />The authors' final conclusion is \\""don't change the subject\\"" where they write that \\""therapeutic education exposes children ... and older people to intrusive interventions that probe, elicit and assess their emotions, and make them accountable for them. This reinforces a view that they are vulnerable and at risk\\"".<br /><br />I liked the best bit of the conclusion when they say that \\""therapeutic education is social engineering of the feeble, passive subject on an unprecedented scale\\"".<br /><br />The final problem to consider, then, is what have we produced here with the learners? The presumption is that most learners are damaged in some way.  I support the view of Ecclestone & Hayes, and would go farther saying that it is rubbish to make such sweeping generalisations on `damage' which the therapeutic educator has done to turn education upside down.<br /><br />The balance needs to be redressed because the saddest thing of all is we produce people who cannot read and write properly, but have a dangerously high ego which is of no value to employers, or ultimately to society which could become `broken' if remedial action is not taken soon.<br /><br />Watching the news over the summer, I reflected on the effects of this experiment with the incidents of violence on the streets, serious challenging behaviour exhibited regularly especially by the young inside and outside the classroom, and, that by `changing the subject' what is actually damaged is society itself because that subject has been changed.  However, it is not too late, to revert to established techniques which returns therapy to its rightful place.<br /><br />I very much hope, after 2010, with our next newish baby boom, that the education balance can be redressed and we get away from the dominance of popular culture on social thought to expand and not diminish human potential and put therapy policy in the limitation box where it belongs.  We should be very grateful, and thank, Professors Ecclestone and Hayes for having the guts to stand up and be counted on this issue- more power to them.and at risk\\"".

It is `yes' because the subject has rightly been `reinvented' and `re-orientated' by them, giving what we all know as a `legal system' or `legal method' both some coherence and foundation which seemed to be lacking before the Human Rights Act 1998 appeared and changed the legal landscape.<br /><br />For this reason, I welcome the book as a major statement on a twenty-first century evaluation of common law as our own legal system becomes more entwined in EU law, and global legal and financial issues (most certainly the financial ones) appear so much more relevant to all than they once did (in the summer of 2008).<br /><br />I was reading this book during the annual Human Rights Law Conference which Justice run each year with Thomson Reuters. I heard many speakers referring to what I see as the main thrust of this work - an evaluation of the general jurisprudence of human rights emanating from the 1998 Act in our current common law context.<br /><br />Jack Straw introduced the 1998 Act, and he has now become our Lord Chancellor (in a reorganised post) whilst I write this review. Straw remains very proud of his achievement which he reminded the Conference he considers (rightly) as being one of the main lasting legacies of the Labour Party's current term in office from the last three Parliaments - a singular \\""big\\"" achievement for the Blair and Brown governments as they have changed the face of law in Britain forever.<br /><br />Gearey, Morrison & Jago recognize that the Act has created a more pronounced judicial intervention into politics which is to be expected with its review of administrative actions in the public sector since the Thatcher years. The greatest value of the book for me is that it places our picture of the common law in its contemporary context and reviews our criminal and civil procedures although none of the authors are practising lawyers (probably a good thing, too!)<br /><br />I found the book highly informative with 16 chapters on jurisprudential themes, each of which examines the pressing issues of the day- especially the tensions between the requirements of economics and the demands of justice.<br /><br />It is quite a deep book requiring a basic grounding in legal method, and I would advise learners to have some knowledge of our legal system before reading it otherwise it will be hard going for some. To me, its greatest value is to be found in placing the common law with each of its historic links covering the four themes they employ: (1) an engagement with the cultures of the post-colonial common law; (2) the notion of judicial practices; (3) an engagement with the notion of procedure or process and (4) human rights.<br /><br />The common law will always be born out of historical experience (mainly precedent) by its very nature.  So, I came away from this book reminded of some of my old political campaigns, mainly against anti EU factions, and I tried to consider the useful practical implications of this work which have opened up a new chapter for all of us: and there are many as the debate opens up.<br /><br />What Gearey, Morrison & Jago have achieved here is the forerunner of a new, stronger debate on the value of the common law in a post Human Rights Act 1998 age which will be upon us shortly as we review the new Green Paper on a `Bill of Rights and Responsibilities'.<br /><br />We will need to place this debate which has begun here in its new context with the EU, and globally, as the new century takes hold and some of our main legislative codes merge as the main challenge to a globilisation of legal institutions one day in the future.utions one day in the future.","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

Why would this be? Because Shakespeare scholars must blind themselves to important truths about the English Renaissance in order to prop up their implausible theory that the semi-literate Merchant of Stratford William Shakspere wrote the Shake-speare canon.<br /><br />So let me highlight a few of the ways in which this anthology corrects some systematic distortions imposed by traditional Shakespeareans. The Preface and Introduction alone are worth the price of the book. They are written by Oxford’s David Norbrook (and are drawn from his 1984 book Poetry and Politics in the English Renaissance). Might the author of the works of Shake-speare have used a pen name because he was an aristocrat? No, say the Shakespeareans—they claim the alleged “stigma of print” is a myth. Norbrook, however, writes that “Many leading poets in the period…circulated their verse almost entirely in manuscript. Print still had to endure a social stigma in a society strongly marked by an aristocratic disdain for commerce.”<br /><br />Shakespeareans deny that the Sonnets have anything to do with the poet himself. He might have been writing poems for a bisexual patron. Norbrook tells us that “the Renaissance is…rich in a poetry of personal address…Renaissance poets were distinguished from their predecessors by a heightened awareness of subjectivity and individuality.” Further, “the sonnet was a particularly sensitive instrument for exploring personal experience in a society which still disapproved of too much individualism, and sonnets must have seemed at times as raw and personal as the work of modern ‘confessional poets.’”<br /><br />Norbrook realizes that Shakespeare is showing undeniable sexual interest in the Fair Youth in Sonnet 20, in the very lines that homophobic readers interpret as reassuringly heterosexual: “one thing to my purpose nothing” in the Fair Youth’s sexual anatomy “is probably reinforced by a play on ‘nothing’ as ‘female genitals’ “ [i.e., the poet is alluding to using the Fair Youth as a “bottom”].<br /><br />Several of Edward de Vere’s early signed poems are in the many editions of the Elizabethan anthology of song lyrics, The Paradise of Dainty Devises. De Vere, Earl of Oxford (1550-1604) was described as having a professional level of musical accomplishment. How is that relevant, you ask? Because Renaissance poets “had the visionary aim of making English words dance in a lost harmony.” Words could create their own music, as “The pioneers of Renaissance opera and song were trying to regain a pristine unity of words and music.”<br /><br />“[Philip] Sidney was excited by the prospect that scholars were at last discovering the secret of the metrical basis of the Hebrew Psalms after centuries of neglect.” Shakespeareans acknowledge that the Bible is one of Shakespeare’s primary literary sources, echoed hundreds of times in his works. But they failed to identify the primary translation of the Psalms that most influenced him. De Vere’s “manicules” and other annotations in his Whole Book of Psalms led to the discovery that this Elizabethan “hymnal” (with printed music) is a previously unrecognized source for many passages in Shakespeare.<br /><br />Shakespeareans base their absolute certainty that “Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare” partly on Ben Jonson’s prefatory material to the 1623 First Folio of Shakespeare’s plays. But Norbrook joins Jonson scholars who freely acknowledge that “honest Ben” was capable of writing with “baffling obliqueness” [as when he spelled the pen name as “Shake-Speare,” a form he used exclusively for invented names in his own 1616 Folio of plays and poems].<br /><br />Norbrook’s commitment to scholarly integrity stands as a rebuke to the special pleading, cherry-picking of evidence, and circular reasoning that lie at the rotten core of the Stratfordian authorship theory.ian authorship theory.","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

So I purchased the volume that contains his narrative essays to see how he makes his own personal life universal.    I've read most everything he's written. My favorite fictional work is his first: _Burmese Days_. It's rather bleak, and so are some of his essays. \\""Shooting an Elephant\\"" may be one of the best essays ever written about the effects of colonialism on the colonizers. I highly suggest it as bedside reading for any budding neo-conservative.    Not all of the essays in this volume are great, but they give you a nice glimpse into the mind of a true English leftie.

The story is moving yet I question the validity of the truthfulness within the content. The concept that a 40-something year old Man can remember verbatum, conversations that took place when he was 12, pushes the envelope of my imagination. Now, with the premise that the majority of the book is a result of a Dream on the night before Christmas, lends even more creedence to a person with a Masters in spinning yarns.    Indeed, the story reminds many adults of the hind sight of our rebellion that can ocurr within our mental physiology as we approach our teen years, and the thoughts that we engage, as we mature.    The story is just another version of A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens in 1843. The ending was abrupt and I felt that the Sweater lost its value from the telling of the Yarn.

Once again, we're given the idea that it is perfectly acceptable to judge girls (and women) by their appearance. One page even mentions having a \\""bad hair day.\\"" The last page is the kicker, though, because it has a large, shiny mirror that the reader can use to decide for herself whether or not she looks like a princess. Ugh.<br /><br />If you are interested in a story about a princess who defies stereotypes, buy The Paper Bag Princess by Robert N. Munsch instead.","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

Until the day he meets an even craftier bully, a witch, who shrinks him down to size.  Once she is satisfied he is abused enough by the forest creatures who return the bullying, in kind, she takes Bruce in as a &#34;kindly old woman&#34; , yet keeps Bruce in his shrunken state.  Bruce apparently has Stockholm syndrome and he readily adapts to the situation.  He lives out the rest of the story as the witch's captive/refugee, only bullying those smaller than him - which are the insects in the garden of the witch's house (as if insects are ok to bully?!). No positive lessons here, to the contrary - some extraordinarily negative lessons promoting unequal/abusive relationships and skewed power dynamics.  I'm quite sure I've never disliked a children's book more.  It's a book not worthy of giving away; where other children may hear its distorted lessons promoted in a positive way.  It's going in the trash.","2015-08-16","2015","Books"

It tells the story of a man who probably has more moral conviction than actual courage.  This is very reflective of many people.    WARNING: If you are looking for a sequel to Little Women, look elsewhere.  This is grittier, raunchier and is linked only by a few characters and nothing else.    It does a good job at capturing some of the basics of the Civil War especially the illustration that most Union soldiers didn't give a damn about ending slavery and also that most African Americans were treated worse after emancipation than before.  Plantation owners had taken much better care of them when they were property than when they became low priced, replaceable labor.    In all I found the pace to be brisk and the emotional conflicts inside Mr. March to be compelling.  He was annoying in some of his silly choices as many of us are.    In many ways, I think it's unfortunate that Brooks chose to link this story to Little Women.  Many reviewers who loved \\""Little Women\\"" are very distraught by the portrayal of some of their favourite characters.  I think the link is a bit gimmicky and subtracts more than it adds.    It's a strong piece of writing that stands well on its own.","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

I own a Texas Longhorn Championship banner that proudly displays Texas' four national championship seasons. Curious about the Razorbacks, I looked up their championship banner, only to learn they don't have one. I wondered, \\""Why not?\\"" I looked up a list of year-by-year national football champions only to find Arkansas not listed anywhere. In 1964, the Arkansas football team was not voted the number one team in the nation only because the AP and UPI press polls closed before the bowl games were played. Alabama was voted #1 in both polls. But on New Years Day, 1965, Arkansas beat Nebraska in the Cotton Bowl to close out an 11-0 perfect record, while Texas beat Alabama and Joe Namath that night in the Orange Bowl, giving both the Longhorns and Crimson Tide 10-1 records. Had the final poll been voted AFTER the bowl games, Arkansas clearly would have been the unanimous choice for national champ. In fact, the very next year the pollsters changed the rules and began delaying the final poll until after the bowl games. I know all about that season because you Hogs beat my Longhorns that year 14-13, a crushing loss for Texas, for had we won that game, Texas would have claimed their 2nd straight national championship. But that was a great Arkansas team, truly the best in 1964! Those three schools - Texas, Alabama, and Arkansas - were the three dominant programs in the nation in the sixties. Among the three of them, and counting the Arkansas team of '64 as national champs, they won an aggregate total of 6 national championships in the sixties. And Frank Broyles was one of the greatest coaches who ever lived. Testament to that is that the Hogs have never since reached the heights he took them to then, nor did they reach them before he first came there. Texas coach Darrell Royal had nothing but the greatest respect for Arkansas, Coach Broyles, and the whole Razorback program.<br />But true Razorback fans know there was a happy ending to the 1964 story, because the MacArthur Bowl trophy, a big silver trophy given after the bowls which is emblematic of the nation's college football championship and is sponsored by the National Football Foundation, was given to the Razorbacks that year, making Arkansas champs in their eyes. To me and to most others, it was the only award that meant anything that year, and yet even today, Arkansas is often not listed as the National Champion for that year. Yet everyone knows the MacArthur Bowl got it right. Consequently, and based on the MacArthur Bowl national championship award, I believe that Arkansas fans should demand their own Championship banner just as so many other schools now have. It should properly list the year 1964 on it, and beneath that it could have a year-by-year listing of the many conference championships won by Arkansas in the late, great Southwest Conference, the greatest football conference in history before greed killed it in the early 1990s. Arkansas deserves not just their own flags, they deserve the bigger Championship banner as well, and this coming from a Texas fan.use the MacArthur Bowl trophy, a big silver trophy given after the bowls which is emblematic of the nation's college football championship and is sponsored by the National Football Foundation, was given to the Razorbacks that year, making Arkansas champs in their eyes.

Provides modern history of the Kurds, mainly the Kurds inside Iraq.  This is not an all-encompassing Kurdish history book, although it does touch on some collective Kurdish events.<br />2. Provides needed perspective on U.S. operations in Iraq: post-1991 and the 2003- invasion.  It shows the Kurdish opinion of U.S. intervention.<br /><br />If you're looking for this scope of information, this is an excellent read.  If you are looking for a complete history of all Kurds everywhere, this is not the book.<br /><br />Having said this, Quil's writing style engages the reader and jumps to related events when necessary to help bring clarity.  This is not a read that stiffly follows a chronological time line.<br /><br />Some takeaways from this book:<br />1. Iraqi Kurds are independent as a nation already within \\""Kurdistan,\\"" probably since 1991, and we simply have not \\""officially\\"" recognized them within an international venue (such as UN).<br />2.

Although Donahue makes a compelling case that the fatal shot that killed President Kennedy came from one of his Secret Service Agents, and that he spent so much of his time researching the case, he fails to prove his supposition that Oswald's first shot deflected off of the pavement of Elm Street, fragmented, and subsequently hit the President. The President's first reaction to the shooting (according to Donahue) was that shrapnel hit him and that he (the President) exclaimed that \\""My God, I'm hit\\"") which is in and of itself questionable.    But, since Donahue is such an expert, and that he KNOWS that Oswald's first shot hit behind the Presidential car and subsequently injured the President, where is the proof? Having read the entire book, he neglects to point out that there are NO bullet strikes on Elm Street that would support his case. No where in the book is even any mention that such a bullet strike hit the pavement or left a mark. Given the extensive investigation following the assassination, it only seems reasonable that a bullet that hit the pavement and then fragmented would necessarily leave its mark in the street. Yet he never mentions that in the book.    This is simply another book that attempts to address an American tragedy where one disaffected loser killed a President.","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

Chances for unwitting and seemingly unavoidable loss of competitive secrets have multiplied, even as information thieves have become more stealthy; always seeming to be a step ahead of contemporary security measures. Mendell shows how twenty-first century business dynamics have made it such that partners and associates are easily turning to aggressors before some companies realize it. This is not fear-mongering. The threats are real , as this book shows. The threat to the integrity of the competitive information of US firms is quite serious. Yet, such information seem to be at the mercy of highly sophisticated and motivated national and international information hoodlums. But no more can these thugs operate with ease. In The Quite Threat, Mr. Mendell has crafted a handbook for every company or organization in the United States that has any competitive secret at all to protect. Indeed, as the book states, \\""friendly competitors don't exist - whether domestic of foreign.\\"" Yet, this book goes beyond enabling security professionals to sharpen their skills as spy catchers, but to make them super experts in counterintelligence and as collectors of intelligence themselves. In other words this book emphasizes proactive intelligence strategies more than reactive techniques. Indeed, it creates agents on the offensive. My fear is that in spite of this book, many firms will still underestimate the threat that they face until something happens, when the damage is already done. I decry the fact that despite the sordid espionage cases that abound, as this book shows, many executives still think that it can't happen to them until it's too late.<br /><br />There are many other books that address corporate espionage but, I seriously recommend this book because it is very comprehensive and yet precise - with only about 184 information-packed pages (Nwankama Nwankama).think that it can't happen to them until it's too late.

I'm so very glad I gave this book a shot anyway, as it's amazing!<br /><br />As the book opens we meet Ross Brigham as he deals with the mysterious death of his estranged father, the fantasy novelist Ed Brigham, and deals with the pressures of his father's agent and fans to finish his father's book. In short order Ross finds himself in Ed Brigham's fictional world of Destin, a place very much like the old West but with elements of modern technology. The world is entirely foreign to poor Ross, who had never read his father's books, but along for the ride are two of his father's biggest fans, who provide a secondary narrative by telling him the history of Destin. Along the way we get action and mystery, monsters and suspense, with a bit of romance, spiritual curiosity and magic.<br /><br />It's a really fun read, and for me, the world Hunt creates, and the bigger questions he asks, puts him in the same category of authors as Charles De Lint and Philip Pullman. His characters reference Stephen King's Dark Tower series, and not by accident, as this novel should appeal to fans of King's work.<br /><br />All in all, it's a fantastic book and a great change of pace.

Apparently, Dawkins persuaded a British newspaper not to publish an article by Milton, and wrote a scathing review of his book. Among other things, Dawkins called Milton a creationist ally or dupe.<br /><br />Milton doesn't call himself a creationist. He's not a Christian fundamentalist, and seems to lack religious affiliation altogether. He even claims to believe in evolution. However, most of his arguments seem to be taken from creationist sources. Since these arguments are anti-evolutionary, they tend to contradict Milton's claim that he does believe in evolution, after all. This in itself was quite enough to anger the Darwinists. By contrast, the creationists were soon distributing Milton's book - I actually bought it from a young earth group in Sweden.<br /><br />But there's more. Milton liberally makes use of arguments from the works of Melvin A. Cook, without mentioning the salient fact that Cook was a Mormon creationist. This explains one of Cook's more curious arguments: that the matter making up our planet might be over 4 billion years old, thus explaining the radiometric dates, but that the Earth might still be very young. Milton rehashes this argument, apparently without realizing that it's based on Mormon theology. The Mormons believe that matter is eternal, but that the gods didn't fashion the Earth out of this eternal matter until about 6000 years ago. Thus, Milton isn't even sure whether the Earth is old, making it even stranger how he can believe in evolution. Here, Milton in effect sides with \\""young earth creationists\\"" or near-young earth creationists (such as Cook) against the \\""old earth creationists\\""! For a secular, non-Christian writer, this is surely unique.<br /><br />In the last chapters, where Milton outlines his own alternatives, it seems that he somehow realizes these contradictions. First, he puts forward Lamarckian evolution and even spontaneous generation as alternatives to Neo-Darwinism. I presume the point is that Lamarckian evolution would be faster than Neo-Darwinian evolution, thereby making it possible to simultaneously believe in evolution and a younger Earth. Of course, spontaneous generation is...well, spontaneous. Second, he presents what I take to be his real alternative. Milton somehow believes that there is a conscious energy field or overmind at work in the universe, a force that somehow evolves (?) all living creatures on our planet, making them change at the right time, inducing their behaviour, and so on. The idea is far from clear, but it sounds like a religious concept, perhaps a form of pantheism or deism. In effect, Milton attempts to fuse evolution with special creation, in a manner that sounds similar to the Theosophists, Huston Smith, E.L. Grant-Watson and (I suppose) Owen Barfield. Nothing wrong with that, per se. However, I must say that Milton is much sloppier in his approach...<br /><br />Milton might not worship the somehow-conscious, somewhat-nebulous Forcefield that brought us here, but functionally it's difficult to see the difference between his conception and the creator-gods of the various religious traditions. Yet, Milton has decided to remain an agnostic. Perhaps he simply wants to be seen as a courageous independent thinker? He is, after all, the patented inventor of...secular young earth near-creationism. If this \\""hopeful monster\\"" can survive, is another matter entirely!<br /><br />PS. I dissed this book rather badly when I reviewed it four years ago. This review (posted in 2012) is a more \\""objective\\"" attempt to approach it.

There's no arguing with his ability to tell or construct a story, or to rhapsodize with effortlessly glittering prose. And there is a scarcely a weak story to be found in this collection. What I do question, foremost, is the man's range. While understanding that a collection of short stories can be connected thematically to be interpreted as a whole, I still was somewhat put off by the sameness which ran through all of them: the circumstances and characters were varied so slightly as to be virtually indistinguishable at times, making for a compendium of utterly bleak tragedies by an author whose world view is one of relentless despair. (Less significant but also worth mentioning is the way Gay repeats certain descriptive metaphors from story to story.)    In portraying the plights of so many lost souls, scrambling for whatever modicum of meaning and comfort they can manage to hang onto in this cruelest of worlds, the humanity Gay presumes to illuminate is at least partially undermined by the raging darkness of a cancerous cynicism which allows for absolutely no hope or light to suffice. Every single story contains at least one death; after a while it just becomes morbidly predictable that the worst-case scenario will emerge. And while one of his characters, Tidewater in \\""the Lightpainter\\"", is overheard \\""wishing everything was black and white instead of incremental variations of gray\\"", the reader may well often wish for the same when it comes to some of the secondary characters who populate these stories. Gay's leads are invariably complex and compelling, but this is often not the case with their foils - the callous offspring and spouses and sheriffs against whom they are pitted. Similarly, it is the overriding and unchanging perspective of stark fatalism which leaves one sensing a lack of dimension in this collection no matter what depth of ambiguity Gay manages to hang on his focal characters.A fully satisfying read only if you enjoy both masterful writing and being informed how patently irredeemable life is.","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

The answer to both questions is a resounding `yes'. DNA is now the indispensable weapon in the fight against crime because it allows both the unambiguous identification of the defendant from traces of biological material left at the scene of a crime, whilst acquitting the innocent.<br /><br />In plain English, `Dealing with DNA Evidence' states how DNA evidence is actually obtained - something many of us are totally unfamiliar with. Semikhodskii describes the various types of DNA test which are available and what the weaknesses of DNA testing are. For the benefit of both the judiciary and the defence, the author explains how DNA evidence can successfully be challenged in the courts so that the impact of such evidence can be minimised, or even dismissed completely.<br /><br />The defence advocate is given even greater assistance with strategies for refuting DNA evidence when presented and discussed during any stage of the criminal justice process.  However, readers should note that the emphasis is squarely placed on DNA evidence so that it can be treated as just another piece of evidence which, of its own volition, would be insufficient to convict the defendant of a particular offence.<br /><br />Who should bother reading this book? Most students I remember from my Bar Vocational Course would run a mile rather than read something like this book.  However, the book must be essential reading for students and practitioners of criminal law and practice, for forensic science and law, and for all practitioners within criminal justice management at whatever level because it is a unique sourcebook for twenty-first century advocacy which no professional criminal justice manager should be without today.<br /><br />Whilst the cases, statutes and regulations are relatively sparse for detail, I came away with the impression that `Dealing with DNA Evidence' presents a fair balance of the tasks confronting advocates in this new frontier of proof.  I always remember hearing a devastating question posed by the great Norman Birkett KC when he asked a hapless witness (allegedly expert) \\""what is the co-efficient of the expansion of brass?\\"" This expert didn't know - round one to Birkett, even if the question was a bit unfair, and possibly irrelevant.<br /><br />What Semikhodskii goes on to say is that when an advocate is faced with scientific evidence, he \\""has to understand it and the prosecution scientist who presents it, as well as the scientist who is working for the defence team\\"".  Counsel will know that their defence job is to highlight the drawbacks of the prosecution analysis presented to a jury and also have the ability to question experts about the subtleties of their supposed scientific expertise.  It is right to say that such questioning is undoubtedly true for DNA evidence because it will be possibly the most scientifically demanding types of evidence available to the Crown.<br /><br />There are eleven chapters in the book covering the following detailed areas of DNA law: An introduction to Criminal DNA Analysis;  Forensic DNA Testing;  Interpretation and Statistical Evaluation of DNA Evidence;  Criminal DNA Databases;  Pitfalls of DNA Testing;  DNA Testing Errors;  DNA Evidence Interpretation Errors;  DNA Evidence During Trial;  Challenging DNA Evidence in the Courtroom;  Post-Convictional DNA Testing; and  Ethical Aspects of DNA Testing.<br /><br />The book concludes with a detailed set of references and a splendid glossary which I feel any person involved in the criminal justice process will find extremely useful.  Readers will find the index detailed and content-heavy which really sums up the subject matter nicely for the subject is technical.<br /><br />Lawyers may wonder why this book is relatively slim at about 150 odd pages plus the referencing material. I felt that this book is actually more of a slim pocketbook on DNA for the advocate for both sides.  \\""Always know your enemy\\"" has been used a standard tactic for centuries so do not underestimate your opponent's DNA case. Semikhodskii writes in his preface that the understanding of how DNA evidence is obtained and evaluated allows lawyers to find pitfalls in evidence and in data interpretation, and to use their skills when dealing with other `id' evidence to highlight them to a jury, concluding that \\""providing lawyers with such information is the main goal of this book\\"".<br /><br />Well, he has scored with that one!  The author goes on to say that a match between the accused and a biological sample recovered from a crime scene `does not and should not automatically mean conviction, even if it is a complete match'.  This is why the subtlety of the book strikes such success - it is the balancing act which Semikhodskii achieves for both sides of the argument so that fairness will prevail.<br /><br />Clearly, this is a book about detail.  However, the case law is somewhat thin at present although R v Doheny and Adams [1997] 1 Cr. App.R. 369 features well on the conflicting sides to expert evidence in the courtroom.  I am sure more cases will follow as they are reported.  The book mainly succeeds with its well constructed writing style which is to explain complicated scientific and statistical issues in simple terms for all.<br /><br />However, there are additional detailed sources referred to such as \\""Forensic DNA Evidence Interpretation\\"" (Buckleton, Triggs and Walsh 2005), \\""Forensic DNA Typing\\"" (Butler 2005), \\""Weight-of-evidence for Forensic DNA Profiles\\"" (Balding 2005), \\""Statistics and the Evaluation of Evidence for Forensic Scientists\\"" (Aitken and Taroni, 2004) \\""Interpreting Evidence\\"" (Robertson and Vignaum, 1995) and the invaluable \\""Genetic Testing and criminal Law\\"" (Chalmers, 2005).<br /><br />These sources give tremendous additional gravitas to an already highly competent book which will clearly become a classic as the century's new discoveries unfold.y slim at about 150 odd pages plus the referencing material.

It's a classic, humorous drama-interlaced story about the formation, rise and fall of a fictional soul band from northside Dublin.<br /><br />The story illustrates how two young men aspiring to respectively play guitar and bass are encouraged by their friend-turned-manager to figure out how to play what he calls Dublin Soul.  The manager places an ad in the local paper and starts recruiting members both seasoned and still learning, young and - in the case of trumpet player and spiritual guide Joey the Lips Fagen- old.  The Commitments gain an immediate following from the moment they start gigging, but they're bogged down by the antics of singer Declan \\""Deco\\"" Coffe and  Joey's \\""interactions with the female singers.  These particulars contribute, along with other matters, to the groups sudden and unexpected demise.<br /><br />Anybody who has both read this book and viewed the film (I actually watched the film dozens of times and purchased the book only recently) will be quick to pick up both the subtle differences between book & film and the immediate ones.  For instance, the pivotal end scene when the Commitments disband is amid a mistake made by Joey The Lips Fagen over the supposed arrival of R&B sensation Wilson Pickett during a gig.  In the original story, the group simply breaks up.  Also, according to the book, four characters reconvene after the original group folds with talk of incorporating four others at a later time.  In the film, all the members go their separate ways, except for the two original members, Derek Scully (bass) and Outspan Foster (guitar), who continue to perform together.<br /><br />When first I read the story, it grabbed me so immediately that I stayed up into the night reading.  Even though, Mr Doyle didn't use common quotation symbols to indicate characters' lines, it was still quite an immediate read.

To me this is a great book and compulsory reading for any would-be planning objector: how often is it that local planning committees have to defer applications because of a lack of proper evidence on noise levels from objectors?<br /><br />Very often unfortunately, and with the extension of licensing powers given to elected councillors the matter has incurred greater interest as not just entertainment licences but our elected council tax spenders now consider liquor licence applications (instead of magistrates) and we are now seeing the results.<br /><br />`Noise Control' by Penn is clearly the foremost publication on the law and practice of noise on the environment and human health. As an Environmental Health Officer, he will have heard the difficult messages from the public but he does not turn a deaf ear to them, fortunately. His new chapter on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (I.P.P.C.) is particularly welcome at this time.<br /><br />Whilst the confrontation on aircraft noise continues inevitably to hum away in the background like a bad vibration, chapter 8 should be required reading to MPs and members of HACAN Clear Skies and its sometimes grubby successors (Plane Stupid) who parade their views strongly with other pressure groups.<br /><br />It's my experience that elected members, nationally and locally, often have considerably insufficient knowledge of noise issues and if Chris Penn does anything, he wakes us up from our slumbers on this most serious of residential issues. Penn gives chapter 9 over to the increasing relevance and importance of the planning process which is so often misunderstood by the protesting public.<br /><br />Do look at the end of the book (page 459) for the `Forms and Records Relating to Noise Control' which Shaw & Sons publish - they will be of great use to those dealing with summary proceedings concerning noise which will not go.rol' which Shaw & Sons publish - they will be of great use to those dealing with summary proceedings concerning noise which will not go.","2008-12-21","2008","Books"

It was the Soviets who were first with Sputnik, first with Gagarin in space, and first in many other ways. They spared no efforts to convince the world that their successes were proofs of the overall superiority of Communism to capitalism. The US simply responded with her own eventual successes--along with a propaganda counterpunch.<br /><br />Nor is Zimmerman trying to promote religion. When citing the readings from GENESIS, he leaves the existence of God an open question. (p. XII). What he does object to, however, is the rejection of the spiritual magnificence of the universe according to the Soviet system of thinking.<br /><br />Zimmerman suggests that the famous \\""Earthrise\\"" photo from Apollo 8 triggered the environmental movement. However, his graph shows that the exponential increase in laws protecting the environment actually began in 1964 (p. 275), which was four years before this historic flight.<br /><br />This book intersperses events on Apollo 8 with other events in the 1960's. There are also \\""flashbacks\\"" to earlier events and earlier space flights. Interestingly, Susan Borman reportedly had serious doubts about the Apollo 8 crew coming home alive, and her doubts about NASA first erupted after the tragic and easily-avoidable launch-pad fire of Apollo 1.<br /><br />The book often puts things in perspective. This includes the power and speed of the rockets, and the distance covered in space in the few minutes that the astronauts were observing and photographing the Earth.<br /><br />So, forty years have passed since my 14 year-old space-nut self had thrilled in this flight.

So Graham Greene wrote in 1980, three decades after his publication of 'The Heart of the Matter.'  Ever a tough self-critic, the novel has been far better received by scholars and audiences than Greene himself.  This widespread success has helped to establish Greene as one of the twentieth century's leading British novelists and, with figures such as Evelyn Waugh, Paul Claudel, and François Mauriac, as one of the greatest Roman Catholic writers in modern history.<br /><br /> First published in 1948, 'The Heart of the Matter' was inspired by Greene's life as a British intelligence officer in Sierra Leone during the Second World War.  Greene, mixing his Catholic background with immense skills in fiction, journalism, and travel writing, penned a social drama that is arguably the best of his career.  It earned the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, Britain's version of the Pulitzer, in its first impression and reached Time Magazine's list of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005.<br /><br /> Taking place in a Sierra Leone township during wartime, Greene draws vividly from his experiences as an MI6 official and the well-known irregularities of his love life.  He immerses us with the novel's opening pages into a hot, humid, and malaria-ridden territory of coastal British Africa; the sweat on one's arms, the constant feeling of being watched, and the sound of vultures clopping on tin roofs predominate this scene.  The locals of Sierra Leone - those of the Black underclass - are illiterate, often born out of wedlock, and fill roles comparable to slavery.<br /><br /> Against this musty backdrop, Greene paints his characters with a simple, journalistic flair.  The focal point is Henry Scobie, a deputy commissioner who is next in line to head the colony's police department.  Scobie and his wife Louise are devout Catholics who seem out of place in their African surroundings: Scobie, while regarded as an honest and efficient officer, is distrusted by his colleagues for being too above-board.  Louise is an aloof and opportunistic woman who has little in common with her husband, including a thirst for social advancement and a love of poetry.  Yet their relationship endures in this bleak setting; marriage has once again become a 'habit,' as Greene so often laments.<br /><br /> Scobie's main asset - a sympathy for those around him - is also his most glaring weakness.  Consumed by a police state where unhappiness reigns, Scobie damages his integrity by taking loans from Yusef, a Syrian gem trafficker, in order to send Louise on a costly relocation to South Africa.  While Louise is away, he falls in love with Helen Rolt, a young woman who managed to survive days at sea following a boating accident that killed her just-married husband.  Scobie discovers his faith as a Catholic, the one power he can turn to, unraveling in this chaos while at the same time galvanizing his link with the divine.  This happens while a London spy named Wilson, who holds childish feelings for Louise, keeps a watchful eye and happily reports to his superiors.<br /><br /> 'The Heart of the Matter,' written at the peak of Greene's literary abilities, is a novel with superb emotional depth and range.  Much of the story takes place as an interior monologue that follows Scobie's ensuing crises in love, faith, and the will to live.  While firmly rooted in Greene's Catholic outlook, the novel extends beyond his faith and deals with universal concepts of self-respect, compassion, and decency: how can one maintain his truthfulness, Greene asks, in a world of lies and deceit?  Should we really have intolerance for deceit when the world appears so rotten?  And is total understanding between human beings possible when compared to the definiteness of a man's spirituality?<br /><br /> Compared to earlier novels such as 'England Made Me' and 'Brighton Rock,' 'The Heart of the Matter' has better-developed characters, a more cohesive plot, and solid narration.  Greene still falls into an overuse of simile and certain events don't happen with a feeling of the inevitable, but 'Matter' still ranks as one of the best-written novels in twentieth century literature and holds a deserving place in Green's 'Catholic' cycle of novels that secured his legacy.<br /><br /> 'The Heart of the Matter' is a frequently-printed novel that can be acquired in used copies on the Internet.  Used for this review was the 1960 printing by Compass Books (C70, 306 pages), a subsidiary of The Viking Press.  More recent editions have appeared from Penguin Books and Vintage Classics.  The novel is an absolute must for Greene fans and highly recommended for all serious readers.haracters, a more cohesive plot, and solid narration.

It will convince you that the universe is a very dangerous place and life is certainly precarious. However I agree with the reviewers who find the characters, particularly in the second part, undeveloped and the ending unsatisfying. Perhaps most significantly is the fact that, although this is a novel of human cooperation, every time people encounter someone different, they start fighting, often with surprise attacks. Stephenson doesn't really do much with this, explain why this is and, if the &#34;Purpose&#34; is trying to derail our present society into a more highly evolved one, why this does not happen, and if this is inherent in the human and evolved human condition, why not. One interesting fact is that the President of the US, who is not supposed to get to space and survive, does and brings the negativity of politics with her, seemingly passing some of these devious, manipulative qualities to her descendants. Is this necessary for human survival, or part of the problem? Stephenson doesn't really go anywhere with this, unlike a number of others in the genre.

Outliers, in statistics, are results that are so extreme that they are generally not taken into account in calculations. So extreme that they are literally off the charts. Malcolm Gladwell's book [[ASIN:0141036249 Outliers: The Story of Success]] is about people that experience this kind of extreme success. People like the most succesful hockey and soccer players. People like Bill Gates. Or the Beatles. What is it that makes people so succesful?    First, it is hard work. To become an expert in a field, one needs at least about 10,000 hours of labor. Like an Asian farmer toiling away on his rice paddy field. The proverbial 99% transpiration that comes with the 1% inspiration.    Second, it is lucky circumstances. Sheer luck. Like being born at the beginning of the year instead of at the end (which makes a surprisingly significant difference in your chances of becoming a top hockey player). Or the country you're from. Or the language you've been raised in (English gives you an early math disadvantage of about a year compared to Chinese or Japanese).    In his previous bestseller [[ASIN:0349114463 The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make A Big Difference]], Gladwell shows that small initial differences can make for a huge end effect on a society. Also his [[ASIN:0141022043 Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking]] was about conclusions we all draw from small differences in quick thought processes. In the same way, this book shows how sometimes incredibly small differences can tip somebody towards extreme success.    Small differences also made for the success of Malcolm Gladwell himself. One of the most precious gifts he allegedly got from his father is the memory of \\""seeing him work at his desk and realizing that he was happy\\"". The same joyous work ethic oozes from the pages of this book.    Gladwell reads like a detective. He brings you science like a professional storyteller. The science,on the other hand, sometimes suffers a bit from this high readability (some conclusions about cultural causes are quite debatable). There are no footnotes in this book, but in the back of the publication, each chapter does have a number of notes to back up some of his claims.    This book is definitely an entertaining read. It is also a good way to weapon yourself against the abundance of success stories that sound a tad too good to be a full version of the truth.","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

Just before his final act, he hand-writes a new will, one that replaces his previously filed will that named his adult children his primary beneficiaries..<br /><br />On Monday, when Clanton, Mississippi attorney Jake Brigance receives a letter from Seth Hubbard and the hand-written will, he’s astonished. The will reads that Seth Hubbard has left 90 percent of his vast holdings to his black maid, Lettie. The attorney doesn’t know Mr. Hubbard nor Lettie, but he feels obligated to handle this case judiciously.<br /><br />The estate is estimated to be $24 million, mostly in cash assets. When Hubbard’s daughter and her husband and Hubbard’s divorced son learn of their father’s death, they come running, unlike their behavior when their father was alive. Of course, they’re already mentally spending their inheritance.<br /><br />When the facts of the hand-written will become known, the chaos begins. Attorneys gather to contest the more recent will, salivating at the money to be earned in defense of the family.<br /><br />The case goes to trial and surprising, even shocking, events are revealed. Author John Grisham, a southerner, doesn’t soft-peddle race relations in the late 1980s, when this story takes place.<br /><br />Readers of Grisham’s first legal thriller, A Time to Kill, will recognize the attorney Jake Briggance and some of the characters from his world. I especially enjoyed the banter between the lawyers.<br /><br />A former attorney, John Grisham practiced Mississippi law before he turned to writing. His popularity is well deserved. In reading his books, you learn about the law, but his stories aren’t steeped in legalese. Coming from the Northwest, I cringed at some of the racial insinuations.

In this novel, Death has a big heart and admits that humans haunt him. This book, written for young adults, starts when a nine-year-old girl named Liesel has to say good-bye to her mother after she watches her younger brother die.  Liesell is sent to live with Hans and Rosa Hubermann, who become her foster papa and mama.<br /><br />Although this book is intended for young adults, I have to think that it would be best read by an older, young adult, as in a mature 15-20 year old, who also knows a little about WWII, or at the very least is interested in history.  Parts of it move slowly, but even the slow parts have a fantastic poetic storytelling quality.<br /><br />Overall, this was a fantastic, cleverly constructed story with characters that were well conceived and incredibly real. As an adult, I thoroughly enjoyed it; however...I'm not so sure that there are many young teenagers that would have the attention span or the patience to appreciate it as a novel read for enjoyment. In my opinion, this could have easily been a five star book, had it truly been writen as an adult story.<br />4 1/2 stars.","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

It's profound in its implications and will resononate deeply with anyone who has ever felt the call of the road, the inexpressible wanderlust of youth. If you read this and don't have a turmoil of clashing emotions for Chris McCandless / Alexander Supertramp, then you missed Krakauer's point entirely.

Timely feedback loops are essential. Thus without the Gift of Pain (see author Paul Brand) , the disease of leprosy devastates the human body. Similarly, without the gift of bankruptcy, flawed economic decisions escalate into a singular Black Swan event. Capitalism uses negative feedback loops in a timely fashion; in contrast, altruism is in open-loop denial until the obvious is in plain \\""King Without Clothes\\"" sight. This lack of negative feedback is the fundamental reason why draconian regulations never go away, but instead get layered in like sedimentary rocks.     Black Swan events are not necessarily negative (witness J.K Rowling's  phenomenal success); i.e., innovations could be deliberately seeded by grasping and tweaking the embedding fat-tail context. Just as there are good-fats versus bad-fats, likewise there are good fat-tails versus bad fat-tails.     All this is connected to E.O. Wilsons socio-biological re-framing of the Darwinian order--individual entities are evolving within the group context; like-wise, thin-tail phenomenon are unfolding within the fat-tail context.  If one respects the individual freedoms, these are not necessarily antagonistic evolutions; unfortunately in the current stage of human evolution, they often end up so. There is a psychologically deep, mirror-neuron level (see author/discoverer Giacomo Rizzolatti) reason why this is so; why altruism often trumps capitalism; why we as a species cannot suffer/witness chronic pin-prick pains, but instead settle for one giant tsunami of overwhelming pain such as the Great Depression.  And we may have to wait for a Wilsonian socio-biological evolution to temper our overactive mirror neurons and learn to accept the small-scale self-corrective bankruptcies before they escalate.     As an aside, Taleb is off-mark in his critique of Modern Portfolio Theory and the associated practice of Risk Management. When governments step in to rip the carpet armed with a collective mandate from populations hooked on overactive mirror-neurons, systemic risk rules; and portfolio diversification is of no value. But MPT was never designed for such a scenario; and neither does Taleb have long-term solutions for this.  But as a timely industry gadfly, Taleb shows the limitations of modern finance subject to systemic assault.  And in his search for the governing fundamentals, Taleb does bring the richness of Cognitive Sciences/Decision Sciences to the table; but missing from Taleb's table are the mirror neurons. All in all, an excellent book to read and read again.","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

I found myself on the net looking for information on the plans of John McChesney and Ketzel Levine -- recently of NPR -- to see how they were handling what I assume to be their own grim news.<br /><br />Judging by Nancy Irwin's You Turn: Changing Direction in Mid-Life (Touch The Sun Publishing, 2008), a collection of career change narratives by 40 folks over 40,  all may not be lost.  Irwin collects stories ranging from a cocaine dealer turned real estate investor to timid housewife turned landscape architect.  Some of the stories are inspirational, told by You Turners eager to share not only the plot twists their careers ensured, but the ideas that got them through the difficult years of transition.<br /><br />Irwin begins the book with several brief  but reasonably sensible essays.  Her essays, intended to introduce the narratives that follow, are not wanting for platitudes (\\""We are all born with a mind, and most people don't have a clue how it works.  I'm going to give you the Manual [sic] for the Mind [sic] so you can start driving your life in the direction you choose, rather than staying on a dead-end street\\"").  Overlook these.  Go instead for the lists she offers up, such as these selections to be savored  -- albeit paraphrased thus:<br /><br />  * Don't wait until you are not scared<br />  * What is the worst possible outcome you can imagine? Could you survive . . .?<br />  * If you could be present at your own funeral, what would you want to hear the eulogizers saying about you?<br />  * What would you do if you knew you could not fail?<br />  * If money were no object, what would you be doing?<br />  * Celebrate milestones along the way<br /><br />The earnestness of the stories in this collection make me reluctant to criticize, especially since many You Turners found themselves, or better put, created for themselves, careers in comparatively rewarding nonprofit or charity sector work.  Alas, there is much advice that is less than helpful. For example, one You Turner complained convincingly about how an abusive husband held back her career transformation. Perhaps this sidebar enhanced the vignette's story, but it also felt off-topic.  Some of the stories sermonize or rhapsodize more than they persuade. Others are self-promotional.  Try to see past those to the personal triumphs.<br /><br />Also, there is precious little about the practical dimensions of You Turns, to which I offer my own short list of somewhat neglected topics in You Turn:<br /><br />  * Finances: funding new education, funding new businesses, bankruptcy, refinancing<br />  * Family finance issues<br />  * What kind of education is valuable for career change<br />  * Mentoring.  It's on Irwin's list (\\""Driving Your Business on A Shoestring\\"" # 11), but figures in only a few of the collected stories.<br /><br />Irwin closes the book with more self-help lists.  List quality varies.  I was unimpressed by the suggestion of SCORE, whose well-intentioned organization of retired workers I have personally found to be uniformly unhelpful.  Irwin also pays too little attention to social networks such as Facebook, MySpace, LinkedIn and professional society forums and blogs.<br /><br />On the other hand, Irwin goes out of her way to point out that each You Turner path is unique, or as she puts it, \\""Life is built on exceptions.  Be an exception!\\""  That each story is unique is proven by the collection.<br /><br />If you find the diversity of stories underwhelming,  go to the book's companion web site, where Irwin invites you to submit your career change story.<br /><br />Irwin's outline for this book is quite strong, and despite regular lapses into Pollyanna-isms,  many of her suggestions will have a ring of authenticity for those of us who have been through the You Turn process. In some respects, the outline is stronger than some of the narratives she has included.  While her emphasis on daring is certainly part of career change,  there is only indirect discussion of how one's existing career and skills can be reapplied elsewhere in ways that may lead you back to somewhere not so far from where you started.<br /><br />One's personality unifies the careers you find yourself inhabiting, like houses you made home for a time.<br /><br />There cannot be too many self-help books on this subject.  You Turn is worth a closer look, even if you find only a few pages of inspiration in it.  It will be inspiration delivered at a time when it's genuinely needed.<br /><br />***The following comments concern aesthetics, not content.***<br /><br />PRODUCTION AND DESIGN It's the publisher's doing, presumably, but I have a few nits about the design and layout of the book.<br /><br />  * Each narrative is accompanied by a photo, perhaps provided by the storyteller.  The photos vary wildly in size, quality and tastefulness.  This creates a dissheveled appearance, as text sometimes flows around these photos, sometimes not.  Some of the photos look as though they were taken from promotional brochures, while others appear to be casual family snapshots.  Most of the photos are so poorly executed that I wished they hadn't been provided at all. To be clear, my complaint here is about the photographers and publisher's art direction, not the career-shifters themselves.<br />  * When I see \\""Dr. Nancy Irwin\\"" splashed liberally throughout the book's cover, spine,  table of contents and chapter titles, I am reminded of the radio program \\""Ask Dr.  Science.\\""  Dr. Science's introductions began \\""He knows more than you do,\\"" and \\""He has a Master's Degree -- in Science!\\""  This is a nontechnical self-help book.

As one who knows Mike from \\""the old days\\"" and attended the \\""Sul Ross Baby Boomers\\"" reunion where his comeback started, I watched everything from the sidelines.  His book carries forward his story beautifully.  Mike was an exceptionally talented linebacker.  After watching him sack opposing quarterbacks I realized I made the correct decision in being a cheerleader. When Mike was expelled because of \\""the fight\\"" I felt that he had truly gotten the short end of the stick, and I had always wondered what happened to him.  For those of us who had lost touch with him, his reputation as a pugilist is best summed up by the comment of a mutual friend when sitting in the lobby of the hotel while people arrived.  One alumni asked, \\""Is that Mike Flynt over there?\\""  Another replied, \\""Naw, couldn't be.  That guy has been there for five minutes and hasn't fought anybody.\\""  Other reviews have addressed the story of Mike's redemption.  My thoughts go more to how Mike's story affected all of his friends who vicariously joined in his experience.  We all have been able to revisit a wonderful time in our lives and have been rejuvenated by his experience.  People who never knew Mike followed his trials and tribulations through all of us who did.  Now they have a chance to read his book and feel what we all felt.  Mike had the chance many of us never have; that chance for a do-over.  Read Mike's story; it will mean as much to you as to all of us who attended his games and cheered him on.  He is a man who has come full circle, from impetuous youth to a man who is solid as a rock in his faith and love of family.  I feel honored to have been able to watch him from the sidelines.  You will truly enjoy this book.","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

I love to stand in the spot where ... happened.  At these times, history becomes reality.  To get the most from visiting a battlefield you need knowledge of the battle or a companion that has this knowledge or a good guidebook.<br />Knowledge of the battle comes from study and discussion.  It is almost impossible for the average person to gain enough in-depth knowledge to make visiting multiple battlefields a vivid experience.  A companion paid or otherwise, is usually a good option.  The problem is they may not be available or able to communicate their knowledge.  Paid guides are expensive and money is not something we usually have in abundance.  This makes the guidebook option one of the best for battlefield walkers.  The book is always available, ready to go when you are and inexpensive.  Most of the books vary from very good to excellent.  Much of the difference depends on what you need from the guidebook.<br />Brooks D. Simpson, Mark Grimsley and Steven E. Woodworth are the editors of \\""The Hallowed Ground: Guides to Civil War Battlefields\\"".  This series has always been excellent and this addition meets and exceeds that standard.  Ethan S. Rafuse is an inspired choice as author for the Antietam guide.  He has in-depth knowledge of the battle, studied under Joseph Harsh and is an expert on McClellan.  Dr. Rafuse acknowledges \\""an enormous debt\\"" to Thomas G. Clemens, Steve Stotelmyer, Mark Snell and Ted Alexander.  Any student of the battle recognizes these names as subject matter expert this guide is put together by the A Team.<br />What a guidebook it is!  In addition to Antietam, we have South Mountain and Harpers Ferry.  Antietam is 14 main stops with several have two to four stops.  In addition to the main tour, there are three optional excursions, Bloody Lane, Burnside Bridge and Boteler's Ford.  South Mountain has five main stops, each having one to three stops.  The Siege of Harpers Ferry is two main stops each having three secondary stops.  These detailed tours will take hours to complete.  The amount of time needed for each of the tours is listed.

It's fine.  Or just okay.  At times it reads like a Jackie Collins-type romance with the breathless aura and steamy lusts and constant choking back of either sobs or bile.  The pacing is quite good and the author clearly took a lot of care in its structure.  Though there are some implausible coincidences and red herrings are thrown in by the bucket load.  And the murdered character never once mentions the name of her killer-lover despite recounting her life in the First Person...not until the end (so readers can join in on the discovery), but it stretches credibility.  But the main reason I docked two stars was for Voice and the Ending.  The story is told from the First-Person POV of three different characters and yet they all come off sounding the same.  The Ending is pretty Hollywood and too neat.  While the reveal of the killer was a surprise, what happens to him was...well, not so unique.","2015-08-17","2015","Books"

It brought to mind the style of H.P. Lovecraft's storytelling, but with an engaging voice unique to author Austin Grossman. He writes Nixon in an immersive way without trying to erase the felonious &#34;Tricky Dick&#34; image, which Nixon himself fully admits to in the novel.<br /><br />Yet the novel never quite follows through on its own promise. Supernatural elements--and Nixon actually exploring them or dealing with them--often remain too far in the margins for my taste. The narrative moves a little too quickly from one moment in time to another, sometimes jumping a few months ahead when I would've liked a little more time to explore the supernatural elements lurking there. While it can be detrimental in this type of story to pull back the curtain entirely from mysterious forces of darkness, I would have liked more of a peek than is given. Perhaps an over-zealous editor?<br /><br />Nixon himself also lacks much agency after the earlier parts of the novel. He hears of things, is acted on by other people, and doesn't seem to do much but react. Certain important events Nixon only hears about, and a confrontation with a major antagonist toward the end is over so quickly that I had reread a couple of sentences to realize what happened.<br /><br />Bottom line: I did enjoy a fair bit of the novel, but found the overall experience not quite as satisfying as I would have liked.","2015-08-17","2015","Books"

One is the writing style is very good. Gladwell is a very captivating author who moves the reader along at a brisk pace. A second is the trivia on Sesame Street was very interesting. I don't have much else positive to say.     I can say many bad things about the book. For one, the book's insights can all be drawn from extrapolating on the title. When an object is tipped, a force is applied to the object perched on a fulcrum. So, the tipping point can be either the fulcrum or the force that pushed the object. The force and/or the fulcrum are important to consider when trying to figure out why the object tipped.     To come to this conclusion, the author makes his points based on anecdotal evidence and poorly presented research. Often times, an example would be presented with the conclusion first, then only the details to support the conclusion with everything else stripped away. Or, a vague, possibly untrue example would be presented with a sort of \\""a ha!\\"" vibe to it. For example, the author bases his chapter on \\""connectors, mavens, and salesmen\\"" on the midnight ride of Paul Revere. The problem is Paul Revere's ride was mostly fiction coming from a poem by Longfellow.     Overall, I was really disappointed by this book.","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

While both are good, Understanding Exposure is much easier to follow. The later is more dry and text bookish; however, it goes deeper into how to develop good shooting skills, not just explaining how exposure works. I recommend both.    This book will take you through the basics of how aperture, shutter speed, and film speed work together. Apertures are split into groups, and explanations given for conditions that are best for each group.     It points out differences between fixed lens digital cameras and digital SLRs; Such as, why there's a difference in depth of field when I used an f/2.4 on a fixed lens and an f/2.4 on an SLR. Advantages and disadvantages for both, when it comes to aperture, were enlightening.     Tips are provided for most accurate light metering, filter use, and freezing or slowing motion, to name a few.

I'm 20 years old and based on the reactions of all my friends, I *should* be going nuts over this book. But after I had read it my overwhelming reaction was disbelief. It is utterly incomprehensible to me that this book was even published. Don't get me wrong-there is some great YA fiction out there-Philip Pullman, Isobelle Carmody, Garth Nix etc. But this just defies belief-it makes me feel that my generation is heading in a very disturbing direction.    Twilight is probably the most pathetic excuse for a best seller ever written, with a terminally monotonous yet obnoxiously whiny heroine who is dismissive and nasty to everyone except vampires, an abusive, controlling, sociopathic 'hero', and a dangerously unhealthy 'romantic' relationship (Seriously, he STALKS her. And she is FLATTERED that she is the object of his obsession.) that fills up over three quarters of the book and is passed off as what real authors would call necessary in a book-a plot. The never ending adolescent angst and the consistently contradictory actions and dialogue from the main characters do nothing so much as make the reader wish to bang his or her head repeatedly against a wall and flail with laughter at the hilarious ludicrousness of it all.    This moralistic trash is a thinly veiled religious rant by a woman who appears to be completely anti feminist. The 'heroine', Bella, passively allows Edward complete control over her and Meyer's implication is that Bella is defined only by her man (who is, unfortunately, a manipulative, schizophrenic headcase and belongs in jail). She gives up college for him, spends most of her time cooking or looking after her father, allows Edward to mentally and physically abuse her, and generally acts as if she has no free will or individual thought if her darling Edward is not by her side-to the extent that she spends the next book trying to commit suicide because he has apparently left her. Yeah, great message to send to your teenage readers, Meyer-'My FIRST EVER boyfriend, who stalked and abused me, has dumped me, so instead of getting on with my life and growing up, I should throw myself off a cliff in despair.'    This 'novel' has no saving graces, other than that Meyer obviously wrote it with an iron conviction that it is classic literature; it just begs have strips torn off it for taking itself so seriously-I was forced to stop reading while I went into convulsions of laughter on several occasions. It has no substance or realism and is forcing dubious moral messages on young teens. It is also devoid of plot, filled with Mary Sue characters and probably would not exist if Meyer had not been able to lay her hands on a Thesaurus: as has been said many times, it reminds one of nothing so much as wannabe Mills and Boon fanfiction. The attrocious use of adverbs/verbs (by the tenth use of 'chuckle' and 'chagrin' I was ready to throw the book at Meyer's head) and irrelevant descriptive passages five million pages long do not endear the book either.     Please, for the love of all that is sane and rational, do not fall into the trap of reading this because the premise-a supernatural/fantasy romance with vampires who *sparkle*-sounds interesting. It is NOT. It is 100% trash. And parents, this book is in NO WAY suitable for your teenage daughter. Adults who are after a really good fantasy read should read Kushiel's Dart, by Jacquie Carey-that is what high fantasy is supposed to be like.","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

Buy this one.","This review is for ISBN-13: 978-0882707570<br /><br />By all means, this is the edition to buy.  I bought this one, AND another edition which was Bunyan's latest edition upon his death in 1688 (13th edition, I believe), and there really is no comparison.<br /><br />I am an extremely well-read individual, and tackle very tough reading projects to ascertain truth.  But when it comes to this story, the modern English translation and all the accompaniments of this edition, make it a sure winner.<br /><br />I read the old and the modern translations side by side.  Only somebody bordering on masochism would want to read the old English version.  Ok, maybe that was a bit extreme, but reading the old English lost everything that this modern English translation has not.<br /><br />The story reads excellent, and has a tremendous outline of references at the end of each chapter corresponding to the numbered footnotes on various words and sentences throughout the story.  I love reading this story with my bible open and referencing the scriptures to see how they line up with the story.  I know the bible very well, and do not look up a lot of the scriptures, but many of them are very good.  Especially when Pilgrim is speaking with the Interpreter (chapter 5, I believe).  The conclusions Bunyan drew from the bible might very well be controversial (can a person lose his salvation and end up damned?).  Bunyan's book had me looking hard at the Word, and repenting to God for lukewarmness, and slothfulness in my own life.  I appreciate this book more than I can say.<br /><br />This edition also comes with an audio CD on various excepts of the book which I did not expect.  I have not listened to it yet.<br /><br />Also, this edition has illustrations throughout.  I love these.  It really helps a reader to get immersed in the story.<br /><br />Now, regarding the story itself:  I find the story to read at an age level that is young.  Maybe even grade school.  But in no way would I allow that to alter my regard for this writing.  In fact, it maybe the very thing that makes a person GET what they are supposed to get from it.  Instead of appealing to our intellectual egos, the book forces you to just get the truth, the story, and deal with your own life in light of God's Word.

In Parliament, David Cameron said: The whole country has been shocked by the most appalling scenes of people looting, violence, vandalising and thieving. It is criminality, pure and simple - and there is absolutely no excuse for it.<br /><br />Whilst in the Guardian, Seumas Milne wrote: While bankers have publicly looted the country's wealth and got away with it, it's not hard to see why those who are locked out of the gravy train might think they were entitled to help themselves to a mobile phone.<br /><br />Stick and Mac; two seventeen-year-old boys from a run-down Manchester estate. Neither of them have a father living at home, both of them are determined to escape their dreary surroundings. They are going to drive to Spain, in Stick's old Ford. They will drive across Europe, so what if it's only two hours by plane? They will drive, that way they will see more places. Stick has never seen the sea.<br /><br />Their cases are packed. They have their Euros. Their mothers are worried but know that they have to let them go. Their going away party is planned. Mac, the joker, wants to dress up. Coconut shell bras, tropical print shirts and sunglasses on, they spend what should be their last Manchester evening in a bar with a sticky carpet getting drunker and drunker. When Mac decides that it is time to leave, Stick is otherwise occupied, in the toilets with a girl wearing a blue sequinned top.<br /><br />That blue sequinned top will haunt Mac for the rest of his days. Mac gets into a spot of bother on the bus during his journey home and never arrives. Stick doesn't see Mac again.<br /><br />Stick is distraught, and angry and filled with grief and guilt and loss. He pushes his family away, he gets drunk, takes drugs, he just wants Mac to come back.<br /><br />When Mac meets J, with her shocking bright hair and the ability to land a good punch, he is intrigued. He sees someone who is like him, who understands, and who will let him talk, and explain.<br /><br />Before The Fire was inspired by the riots, but isn't really about the riots. It is a story that is exquisitely written, about rage and grief, and about modern day living. Stick is not the nicest of lads, he's uncouth, he's self-centred, he drinks too much, takes drugs and thinks about sex quite a lot. However, he is pretty realistic, he's seventeen, he's out of work, he lives with a mother who has issues of her own, his dad has a new family, his sister died in a fire and now his best mate is gone.<br /><br />Sarah Butler's writing is bold and daring. Her ability to recreate the mind of a young man is stunning, and despite the horror of the riots, she enables the reader to empathise with the rioters. She has an understanding of the whys and the hows, without condoning what happened.<br /><br />This novel is gritty and very near to the knuckle. Some readers may be shocked by the language, by the lifestyle choices of some of the characters. This is brutally honest writing and whilst it exposes the seedier side of life, it is also very beautiful. Whilst the language may be coarse, the message is true and clear, the exploration of the devastation of grief and loss on family and on friendship groups is precise and striking.<br /><br />Before The Fire is a clever, modern, poetic novel. It is complex, exploring issues that are often glossed over, with grace and ease.<br /><br />I am very impressed by Sarah Butler's writing, she is an author that I am sure will keep us entertained for years to come","2015-08-17","2015","Books"

I've seen books described as everything from fast foods to rich desserts (and a few comparisons that were not so flattering). If I were to compare `Shadow of the Ghost' (Tanner Artesz) to food, it would be a smorgasbord of plotlines, characters, and settings, spiced with humor. The offerings would be expertly prepared, with rich and exciting flavors and overtones.  Mr. Artesz writes well.<br /><br />I will not summarize the plot here, as other reviews have already done so. I will simply comment as to what I perceived to be the strengths and weaknesses of this work. First, the strengths: The writing is very competent and well edited. The author makes excellent use of imagery and exposition, so that the reader is well placed in the scene.  There are too many characters to develop them all, but some are developed well. They are interesting and unique to say the least, particularly Ky, the main character. It is quite obvious that the author really, really enjoys and cares about this character--a good thing in a fantasy. `Shadow' is not like any other fantasy I have read; it is a unique approach.<br /><br />Nothing about this book is simple. Ky, the main character, is an enigmatic little elf, who turns out to be quite the force to be reckoned with. I wasn't sure whether I liked him for a few chapters, but once I began to realize his nature, I warmed to him. By the time I came to the end of the story, I really enjoyed him (when is an elf NOT an elf....?) I will say no more.<br /><br />Only `down' side: this is a complicated, multi-layered story requiring attention, or one may be quickly lost (at least, I was). I found some parts confusing, but after a bit of explanation by the author, I was back on track.  This is not a story to be tackled by an under-motivated reader--this is a challenging tale that will keep you engaged, as long as you don't allow too many distractions. The four-star rating reflects my occasional confusion rather than the quality of the writing.<br /><br />The diversity of characters suggests roots in RPG, and I have recommended this book to any and all of my `gamer' friends. They will have no trouble following it. I wouldn't recommend this book for mindless entertainment; however, if you want to be intrigued, challenged, and excited by a good, intricate plot line, `Shadow of the Ghost' is for you.of the writing.

Why is there controversy over it? Actually, the people who wrote these comments don't seem to understand fiction - or the Anne Rice (in her vampire days), for that matter. I am a fan.    Here's the deal. If you are a Anne Rice fan - you will love the book. My suggestion - don't read it without picking up the Mayfair Witches series. I read them all, and Blood Canticle weaves all the worlds together, quite nicely. I read something about how the person didn't like how she wrote some of the characters - but I don't think they understood the power of Lestat, or the allure. A new leader emerges from this - and could bring up a \\""new\\"" world, but unfortunately, we would never know. Yes, the book does start of kind of slow, but towards the end I was fascinated. Is it the best out of the series? No. but, everyone has it's favorites. Is it the worst? Certainly not. And the most compelling thing - the return of Lestat. It's a great piece to add to the collection. Do not let \\""controversy\\"" (over what, i can't even contemplate) steer you away. Anne Rice is as she always was, and her story is a treasure. I am sad to see the Vampire Chronicles come to an end. She is, and always will be, the best author in vampire (and witch) lure.     But dear one, see for yourself.","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

So now parents don't have to think about their older children getting into casual sexual relations. Wrong, suggests the author.    With dating, males make significant efforts; gather money, transportation, etc to make a date possible. Dating was a test of a male's ability to manage resources. This was true in colleges where males were a majority during the 20th century.    Males are in the minority in colleges in the 21st century; 40% to 60% females, typically. Males are \\""scarcer\\"" and no longer have an edge in jobs as they used to. Male resources are no longer larger than those of the females.    These conditions have led to less dating and now females often have to now seek out a male if they want a relationship with one. Also, males \\""pick and choose\\"" more often than they ever did in the past. Even if a female might want to see the same male repeatedly, the male is freer than ever to opt out. Instead, the male can opt for brief sexual encounters with different females.    Hence, we have the \\""hook-up.\\"" This serious sounding term is actually vague as it can mean getting together for just kissing and necking or it can mean sexual intercourse. It is not a repeated relationship with the same person. In fact, some females might wind up waiting for a \\""call\\"" to \\""come over\\"" and \\""hook up,\\"" with just a simple text message.    This situation is gloomy for a female looking for a marriage mate. Options seem few. The writer of this review suspects that females asking males out on dates might be an effective option.    The author of this book uses stories of people that she has interviewed to describe details without elaborate statistics. She also describes her methods of getting students to \\""tell all,\\"" interesting to people doing surveys. Overall, the book is good for keeping up with the Gen Y culture...","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

He's destined for the priesthood, since his family backed the losing side in the last dynastic battle and their lands were confiscated, but he's uncertain about his calling.  When he discovers the dead body of the Harper's mistress while on business for his Uncle, it falls to him to investigate the murder, and he finds it a welcome distraction.  Another welcome distraction is the master mason's daughter, whose quick mind helps him during the investigation.<br /><br />The murder takes place after the May Day festivities, and we get a wonderful glimpse of the celebrations taking place in a Medieval city, with musicians and maids and lads out looking for a bit of fun and gentlemen and ladies up to no good.  The characters are all very sympathetic and interesting.  The mystery was a good one, with some twists and turns and several suspects.

One book -- by far the more interesting -- tells the story of the creation of American financial capitalism between 1880 and 1920.  This was the era when giant corporations were formed via mergers financed with watered stock, and when middle-class American consumers developed an appetite for share ownership.  The result was an economy comprised of large corporations driven by the need to show returns to widely dispersed investors.  It's an interesting story that explains where the modern American economy comes from.  This books gets five stars.      The second book -- alas -- reconstructs the political and legislative maneuverings behind various now-obscure corporate reform efforts in the early 20th century.  I don't know why Mitchell included this tedious material, which could have been reduced in length or left out altogether.  Maybe, having done the research, he felt compelled to include it.

Had to get this one since my husband is a big fan of casseroles and they are often a great go to idea when you just need something new to make.<br /><br />Once again, I can rely on her books, every recipe I've tried has been great and many combine such interesting ingredients.  And thankfully most of the ingredients are easily obtainable even in my back of beyond location.<br /><br />I also love the section where she gives great tips on how to make up your own casserole recipe using a protein, a starch, a vegetable, etc.  And oh how happy I am that she included simple sauces to substitute for canned soups!  That has been the downfall of so many casserole cookbooks, they blithely say and add a can of mushroom soup.  Well some of us don't like canned soup for taste or health reasons and Beatrice now shows you how to make some very simple sauces to use instead of them.<br /><br />I have a chicken thawing today and will try her oh so simple sweet and sour chicken casserole.  I mean all you have to do is combine chicken broth and rice in a casserole dish and lay the skinned chicken pieces on top then mix a simple sweet sour sauce together with canned crushed pineapple and pour it over.  Cover and bake for about 1 1/2 hours.  Now how easy is that?<br /><br />Thank you, Beatrice, you are thought of often in this kitchen and with much gratitude.","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

It appealed to fans of the series such as myself by checking in with past characters, while being careful not to detract from the central couple.<br /><br />The Plot:<br /><br />Noah, the king of the Demon race, decides to seek out his Imprinted mate, or soul mate. With the help of the Druid Corrine, he finds her--only to discover that her life is filled with pain and danger. Kestra is a mercenary bomber who leads a thrill seeking life that covers a shadowed past. She is not immediately thrilled at being plucked from that life by Fire Demon Noah, but she quickly learns that she cannot deny her passion, or her emotional connection, for him.<br /><br />Why It Earned A Perfect Five:<br /><br />It was never boring. The plot just kept going, from perilous situation to emotional turmoil to hot sex. It's not a book you want to put down.<br /><br />Noah is an extremely sexy and appealing character. He has a lot of deep emotion, charisma, wisdom, and strength-and it is all evident in this story. Kestra is fairly interesting as well, being a very independent and feisty woman.<br /><br />Thematically, the book addresses a lot of common emotional issues.For example, Kestra has trouble trusting, and more importantly trouble loving. Her pain easy to relate to. The resolution of this ongoing problem is believable.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to any Jacquelyn Frank fans as a stunning addition to a wonderful series.","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

I still remember reading the book through the night and simply being unable to put it down. Just as with the other book, his writing is very smooth, easy to digest and simply impossible to put down. This book is really two short novels in one. The first being a 170 page story about an Aztec monster out for fresh blood in the desert and the second, an introduction to the Harrow series, about a man who was reborn as a monster with insatiable appetite for lust and sacrifices. Each one is so very different but it showcases Clegg's intense way of conjuring ideas and his ability to translate them into books that are easy to read. He's slowly becoming a staple on my bookshelf and I can always count on him for a fantastic mix of horror and fantasy that somehow feels real.    The first story is called \\""The Attraction\\"" and its strength relies on the sharp and spot on character development. I adored the relationships he build between the five friends who went on a road trip though the dry, hot desert, somehow getting stranded in middle of nowhere, close to danger. I got to like some, dislike others and then I got to read about them coming across an ancient Aztec mummy, said to be the scraper of the bones who drank the blood and danced for rain in the ancient times on top of the pyramids. Its no secret that something happens and the monstrum comes to life, what happens next is the real beauty of the story. Be prepared for some gruesome devouring, the tale is good but ends a little tame for my tastes. Overall I love the characters and enjoyed the imaginative new nemesis that I have never read about before.    The second novel is about a very bad man who gets entangled in some very dark magic; it's a little intro to the wonderful Harrow series, about a haunted private school with many skeletons in its closet. It was a really dirty and intense story but really good at the same time, perhaps it's a good thing it was short because it was immensely dark and rich with truly horrific ideas.    I engulfed this book over the weekend and can't wait to get back to reading some more of Clegg, he's a real diamond in the rough and his stories entertain both the mind and the imagination.    - Kasia S.","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

Not surprisingly it creates confusions for her. But, just to think of such a thing suggests some strange sexual chracteristics. What she finds out about men is not at all flattering. But the book is even-handed with some caustic comments about women also. Maupin rescues a girl about to become entrapped by one of the most unlikeable specimens of malehood. But how can she (still appearing to be a man) take under her wing a girl to care for her?<br /><br />Gautier starts the book with a series of letters describing the confusion in the life of a young man, D'Albert. D'Albert takes a mistress, Rosette, because he is distressed about his own lack of fulfilment (what's wrong with him we may wonder?). But the mistress happens to have been disappointed in love because she had fallen in love with Maupin (apparently a man) who had to reject that love because .....<br /><br />D'Albert has a fulfilling relationship with Rosette but someohow it is not satisfying. When Maupin returns - perhaps feeling guilty over how she had abandoned Rosette, perhaps even wanting to explain - D'Albert is captivated. He fears he must be homosexual, with all the horror or shock that entails as a realisation at the first instance. Perhaps we do accept homosexuality more readily these days, but it must still come as something of a shock to an individual. To me even the realisation of heterosexuality was something of a shock and I could only get used to the idea by thinking of biology and the 'normalness' of sex (why is it so hidden I wondered - and still do).<br /><br />But D'Albert is profoundly heterosexual in his love for Maupin even though she still appears to be a man. The consummation of their love is both rewarding and disappointing to D'Albert. And in the end Gautier implies things about Maupin - and even Rosette - that are less clear.<br /><br />This is a wonderful, evocative novel; erotic and sensual. Perhaps the plot stretches credibility a bit - if D'Albert had been a less unsettled man himself ..... But it doesn't matter if you are male or female, prepare yourself for some sharp observations on the behaviour of your own sex.<br /><br />other recommendations:<br />'Indiana' - George Sand<br />'The Secret Power of Beauty' - John Armstrong<br />'Diaries' - Alma Schindler (Mahler-Werfel)ocative novel; erotic and sensual.

Because of the errors in the cuff-down pattern, I now distrust the other patterns in the book, including the toe-up, and haven't tried any of them.  Therefore I can't recommend this book to any knitter, beginning or not -- especially since there are several other beginners' sock-knitting books on the market with perfectly accurate patterns (including Ann Budd's \\""Getting Started Knitting Socks\\"").

After reading this book, I almost wish she had stuck with her original plan. The writing, usually so well-done and textured, was flat and at times stilted and convoluted (claiming people who have felt 'true shame' had less fear of death? Really?). It almost feels as if she was pressured into writing this book, and her lack of enthusiasm shows. This would have been a good first try for a fledgling author, however for a veteran like Kleypas I expect much better than flat, undeveloped characters and a tale scattered with romantic tropes and a chaotic yet boring storyline.

Stanford's constant use of Southern African American language is completely convincing and the \\""hero\\"" Francis has obviously lived around them so long that it is simply his culture.<br /><br />Stanford's raison d'etre here (I think) is to shove our faces in the lives of the downtrodden, criminal, and those rejected by society.  From castrating carnival midgets to one legged black felons spit upon by \\""Johnny Law\\"", the cascade of surreality and the dank smell of mud is enough to throw any reader off the course of certitude. This is like William Faulkner having a really bad day and enjoying the hell out of it.<br /><br />Resurrecting the monster of Southern machismo, racism, and madness is not the whole thing.  Death is.  Death follows Francis Gildart (Stanford's real name) everywhere, and nearly all the antiheroes in the book die.<br />Francis comes so close so many times one wonders if he's interested<br />in it.<br /><br />Stanford did the world of poetry a disservice by ending his own life.  This brilliant work reflects clearly that Stanford had an ongoing dialogue with Thanatos and it fuelled a lot of his poetry.  A must.","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

I finished that first story, but was so disappointed that I didn't bother reading the rest.  (Thank goodness for public libraries.)  I can't speak for the rest of the book, but as tedious as this first story was, I doubt I missed much.    The alien is mostly a background figure.  He is one of several who arrived on Earth recently, apparently as tourists.  He makes a few brief appearances, and other characters speculate about whether he's making moonshine, but mostly people go about their boring small-town lives.  They fight with their spouse, shop at the hardware store, manipulate each other, think about making moonshine, occasionally make moonshine...  While it's bad form to spoil the ending, I will say that it's both unsurprising and unexciting, and there's no attempt to shed any light on the alien or his fellows.    It's possible that the author wanted to make banality the point of the story, i.e. even if an alien shows up everyone will still go about their pedestrian little lives.  If so, I suppose it's a success, but unless you're into depictions of boring small-town lives, it's not much of a read.","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

Perhaps it is because the subject just did not peak my interest.  I found it difficult to follow along with all the information about the urban explorers.  The actual story was somewhat interesting, but the whole idea left me feeling almost violated, which I guess may have been Hines' goal in the first place.    Lucas, the main character, is a loner who hides in buildings and spies on the inhabitants. But he soon becomes aware of a more sinister group- The Creep Club- that goes beyond simple spying and moves it to a more personal level.  What follows will leave you weary to the point where you may find your hair raising every time you get \\""that feeling\\"" that someone is watching you.

Speaking about her belief in simplicity and understatement really struck me as something most Americans (in which I include myself) couldn't fathom believing in ...which made it all the more poignant. It also helped that she didn't thank \\""God\\"" or \\""Jesus\\"" or some other deity like the other 90% involved in this collection did.<br /><br />Some might find my comments about belief and religion to be offensive and if you do, I apologize for the nerve this may have struck in you. But belief isn't the sole domain of religion. One can believe in humanity, general goodness, and other things that don't require a belief in the unknown and unseen.<br /><br />Probably the biggest issue I had with this collaboration was that there were scientists and war torn victims of Vietnam who ended their beliefs firmly within \\""God's grace\\"". I was highly interested in the story of the young girl who was the focus of a famous Vietnam War era photo; you know the one, the one with the burned, naked girl running down a street after her village was napalmed. Initially I found her story riveting as she explained the intensity of the war and her villages suffering at the hands of the American military machine. But then her focus shifted to that of her newly acquired christian faith, something that completely turned me off considering christiainity was not a part of Southeast Asian culture until the West arrived. It struck me as ludicrous and contrived.<br /><br />Still, the larger issue of this series is that it shows us belief structures across socioeconomic, race, and many other barriers. It's just too bad so many of them ended up within biblical contexts and didn't range further afield.","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

It's very difficult for me to understand how anyone could have given this book a positive review.<br /><br />As just one example, in the Preface the author says this: &#34;Basic knowledge of relational databases such as Ruby, HTML, and CSS is also required.&#34; Yeah, okay ... except Ruby, HTML and CSS are not relational databases. Probably just a slip up but, still, if you can't get something basic like this right, it does at least make me worry about the rest of the content, which is presumably a bit more technical and difficult.<br /><br />The Preface also mentions that &#34;This book is for web developers who are getting started with Rails&#34; but then almost immediately afterward it says &#34;a fundamental understanding of Rails is required&#34;. So, really, not for someone who is &#34;getting started&#34; with Rails. In fact, what you need is a fair amount of exposure to Rails and at the very least know how to use the generators to create various types of resources as well as understanding where those resources are stored and how you are likely to populate them with code.<br /><br />Right at the start of Chapter 2, the authors says: &#34;Previously, in Chapter 1, Devise -- Authentication Solution for Ruby on Rails, we have talked about mass assignment rules written in the app/controller/application_controller.rb file&#34;.<br /><br />This is absolutely false. The application_controller.rb file is not mentioned at all in chapter 1 and no &#34;mass assignment rules&#34; whatsoever are specified. So when the author says &#34;add username to the sanitizer for sign-in and sign-up&#34;, if you don't know what the &#34;sanitizer&#34; is, you are out of luck. He does provide some code -- but in an odd way. Rather than just showing you the Ruby method which is called &#34;configure_permitted_parameters&#34;, his code listing in the book has a comment that says &#34;#these codes are written inside configure_permitted_parameters function&#34;. So ... why not just show the actual code then? It literally makes no sense at all. Later he does in fact show you the full code ... or at least most of the full code. But it doesn't actually work as described.<br /><br />Further, the screenshot on page 19 -- related to all this half-baked code -- shows you the results of code that hasn't been described yet. In particular, the password confirmation.<br /><br />By this point -- and keep in mind, I'm only at the start of chapter 2 -- it's very clear this book was not edited for content. What I'm describing are things that any person reading this would find immediately. Case in point: I'm reading this and found them immediately. That's why I can't understand how anyone could possibly give the book a positive review unless they were biased to do so or were incredibly tolerant of poorly presented information.<br /><br />As you get to this point in the book, you also start to realize that nothing about Devise is really being explained to you in any sort of substance. You're basically just typing in code that the author (sort of) provides, but with very little context for why or how the code works. So I found myself hopping to the Devise page and reading up on the details there. And I realized: I can pretty much get all the information in the book online, with the difference being that the online material will likely be easier to consume and apply.<br /><br />Needless to say, by this point I (a) gave up on the book and (b) counted myself lucky that I was given a free book and did not waste money on this.","2015-08-17","2015","Books"

She loves to pretend that she is the Mayzie bird - but a better Mayzie bird, who hatches her own eggs.  Ever since we first read this story, she keeps a basket of Easter eggs nearby that she sits and sits on, trying to be a good bird and hatch.<br /><br />In HORTON HATCHES THE EGG, Mayzie is too bored and too lazy to hatch her own egg.  She convinces Horton, an elephant who is faithful 100 percent, to egg-sit for just a short while.  But, Mayzie is gone for nearly a year, and our faithful Horton sits on that egg come rain, shine, snow, hunters, kidnapping, and the ridicule of his friends.  And in the end, he is justly rewarded for his hard work and faithfulness.<br /><br />Only Theodor Geisel can tell a story like Dr. Seuss.  Kids and adults alike are drawn to his weird and whimsical characters, and his wonderful, meaningful messages.  His tales are all told in rhyme and are pleasing to the ear and the tongue - perfect for reading aloud.<br /><br />HORTON HATCHES THE EGG is a lesser known work of Dr. Seuss, but my daughter and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it.

While I have not read Harry Potter, I can say that I would nto expect any similarities in writing styles due to the fact that they are different people and stories.    Anyway, I love the Twilight saga.  It is a mixture of romance, drama, and in my own opinion, the simplicity of the characters makes it better.  It isn't overly fantasized, making it easier to relate to.  The characters Edward and Bella are easy to become fascinated with, and they leave you wanting to know more.      If you are looking for a book with significantly fantasized elements, then this book is not for you.  It is a simple yet fun to follow romance between two very different young people who were brought together by fate.","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

The first half of the book is a murder mystery featuring several obscure Silver Age Batman characters (the League of Batmen anyone?...yeesh), and the ending comes out of left field. That's not necessarily a bad thing, this was a murder mystery after all.      The second half is Batman facing down agents of the Black Glove and fighting his way through a few Batmen impersonators with an ending which leads directly into the Batman: R.I.P. storyline. The last half felt more like a Batman story than the first half.      When I read a comic, I expect to be entertained. I don't like having to \\""try\\"" and understand what's going on in a book. It's escapist literature not Shakespeare. If I finish reading something I don't want to reread it again just to try and make heads or tails of what is going on.  Honestly, I have this problem with a lot of Grant Morrison's work whether it's in New X-Men, JLA, Final Crisis, 52, Seven Soldiers, or even Arkham Asylum. I find myself just wishing he'd stick to the plot and enertain without all the obscure, overly kewl, heavy handed, metaphorical storytelling. Guess his stuff just isn't for me. To each their own I suppose.     The artwork by JH Williams was very good. The Tony Daniels chapters were OK as well.     As stated above, the second half of the book is better than the first, but not good enough to save the collection in my opinion.  Honestly there's better out there to waste your time and money, especially in today's economic climate.      Save your twenty bucks and go find Batman: The Killing Joke, Batman & Son (also by Grant Morrison), or even Batman: Hush.  I'm selling my copy and going after something new.","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

While PPD (Post Partum Depression) has gotten a lot of coverage in the media........I was totally unaware of \\""Perinatal Mood Disorders\\"" (Mood Disorders that occur during pregnancy).  I suffered from Panic Attacks during my fifth month of pregnancy, and the experience was very upsetting to have to deal with during what you think is supposed to be a happy time.  My doctors seemed to confuse \\""Panic Attacks\\"" and \\""Axiety Attacks\\"".  Everyone kept asking me if I was worried about the baby or my ability to be a parent.  That was so not what this was about.  My first attack literally woke me up from sleep and my heart was beating furiously and my mind was racing, and I couldn't go back to sleep.  The continuation of these types or episodes, coupled with my OB/GYN treating me like some kind of \\""head case\\"" only perpetuated my fear about what was going on.  I was really scared about what was happening to me, and fearful about the advice I was getting (to start taking anti-depressants during my pregnancy).  Thankfully, my panic attacks stopped as abruptly as they started and I did not require any medication for the duration of my pregnancy.

His brother, the Duc de Montpensier, a water colorist, has a diary dated June of 1997-November of 1797 included in the book. However, as a New Yorker I felt cheated as the entire northern part of their journey is not found in this book. I am not clear as to why. Louis Philippe's diary ends in Bairdstown. We see a water color of Niagara Falls, and nothing more of NY, and absolutely nothing of the northern states in which they journeyed on the second portion of their trip, though the route which extends all the way to what is now Maine is clearly shown. While it has been suggested some of the records are missing, this does not explain why there are records of the second leg of the journey posted on the Internet, yet not in this book, though Napoleon's Hundred days in 1815 was included. Though the Hundred Days was interesting, I wanted to witness the entire journey of Louis Philippe in America, not just in the South.     Additionally, the journal as written by Louis Philippe is very detailed and contains sharp observations regarding bridges, Indian villages, etc, but gives us precious little insight into the three princes themselves. It is almost strictly a record of what they witnessed, rather than their interaction with the people in early America.","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

This one, like the previous six, features wonderful writing, a further sensitive and perceptive development of the relationship and personalities of Duncan Kincaid and Gemma James, and interesting, well-drawn characters and suspects.<br /><br />However, the plot is not up Crombie's usual standards.  The mystery begins with some sort of supernatural communication from a long-dead monk to a modern-day architect, Jack Montfort, who happens to be Kincaid's cousin.  This communication, in the form of some sort of involuntary writing in Medieval Latin which comes to Montfort while in a trance, provides the continuing thread for the entire plot.<br /><br />Crombie (and all of her characters) apparently take this notion seriously.  No rational explanation is given for this phenomenon, nor for the mysterious power of the nearby \\""Glastonbury Tor\\"" - a forbidding, bleak, low mountain that dominates the landscape.  There are vague echoes of \\""Rosemary's Baby\\"" in the story.  But that movie never resorted to out-of-body experiences to explain the plot - everything that happened was the result of pure human evil, which is a lot easier to believe in.<br /><br />For me, the New Age irrationality and unreality detracted mightily from the pleasure of reading Crombie's superb writing and character development.  I hope this book was just an aberration.","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

And so it is with Katinka Loeser and the realm of parenthood. If you have ever had a child, or if you've ever been one, you cannot fail to be moved by these short stories.     The range of this colleciton is wide, its mood varied. In \\""The Permanent End\\"" Miss Loeser writes wryly of the equivocal satisfaction of a mother in being not so much loved by her brood as tolerated, needed and taken for granted; in \\""Whose Little Girl Are You?\\"" her picture of the unconcern of a little girl with only a few months to live and the terrible bravery of her mother is wrenchingly conpassionate. Another story, \\""There Are Smiles,\\"" manages in a few lines of dialogue and description to capture completely the swagger and doubt, humor and tenderness, of a growing boy. While, with a touch of fantasy, \\""End of a Season\\"" reviews both a summer and a lifetime in a story that is at once homely and sophisticated, both funny and sad. These stories are marked by a strong sense of the flow of life between generations, from younger to older, as well as from parent to child.\\""","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

Susan Shumsky is an extremely erudite author, and always expatiates on all aspects of the subject she is dealing with.<br /><br />We are informed that fluoride can calcify the pineal gland, but that certain foods can aid in its decalcification, e.g. garlic, lemons, apple cider vinegar, hemp seeds, nigella sativa, seaweed, etc, etc. Obviously, we should avoid toothpaste containing fluoride.<br /><br />In a chapter entitled “Overcoming psychic blocks” we are enlightened about psychic knots called granthis, one of which is in the third eye area. We are instructed as to how to remove these blocks by means of bandhas (muscular locks) and mudras (physical gestures that affect your body's energy flow), but these exercises proved too difficult for me, unfortunately. (We are also told to consult with our physician before attempting to practice them or any of the exercises in the book, I understand that. But my physician, for one, would not have a clue about any of this!)<br /><br />There is a chapter about developing one's super-senses. This was easier. We are given a meditation in which we simply ask Spirit to help us open our third eye. This is very helpful. The material corresponds to that in Susan's book “How to hear the voice of God”.<br /><br />In another wonderful chapter we are informed about the Siddhis, the supernormal powers described in “Yoga Sutras”. Again we are instructed how to ask for these, one at a time. I was delighted with this chapter, though I have more basic things to ask for than the Siddhis!<br /><br />Subsequently, there is another difficult chapter about Third Eye Alchemy, more precisely, the “dantians”, which are “vital centres for energy cultivation, diagnosis, and healing”, and a chapter about nectar, or soma, in our third eye. Susan states that the chemical DMT, produced by the pineal, might be a generator of spiritual or mystical experiences.<br /><br />We're then accorded breathing techniques for opening the third eye, and again warned to consult with our physician before attempting any of them. Susan also provides us with yoga asanas, or postures, with accompanying helpful diagrams. I'm still having to pass over all these various methods for opening the third eye. (I appreciated the method where you merely had to get into a meditative state, and ask for it to be opened!)<br /><br />One of the best chapters, for me, was the one entitled “Third Eye Affirmations”. We are provided with excellent affirmations like those in my favourite book of Susan's called “Miracle Prayer”, an indispensable book.<br /><br />One short affirmation, called the Divine Light Invocation, by which to experience awakening of the third eye, is as follows:<br /><br />I AM the divine light.<br />I AM the light of God.<br />The light of God fills and surrounds me now.<br />The light of God permeates me and floods me with peace.<br />The light of God infuses my being with radiance.<br />The light of God lifts me with its power and glory.<br />I AM glorified by the light of God,<br />Which vibrates within me and all around me.<br />Thank you, God, and SO IT IS.<br /><br />While speaking this affirmation, we should imagine God's light filling and surrounding us with divine power and glory.<br /><br />We are gifted with various affirmations, including a third eye invocation and a “treatment” for opening your third eye.<br /><br />In the next chapter we get instructions for doing Susan's breakthrough session, as given in some of her other books. But I find the chapter in this book to be more specific.<br /><br />Susan tells us that the Divine Revelation Meditation practice is a powerful way to open your third eye and develop clairvoyant, clairaudient, and clairsentient abilities.<br /><br />In one of the final chapters, we are provided with accounts of the exciting third eye experiences of some of Susan's clients or readers.<br /><br />To sum up, I would strongly recommend this immaculately written and erudite work, which suggests multifarious ways of opening the third eye, so there are at last a few that everyone can do! Good luck!third eye, so there are at last a few that everyone can do! Good luck!","2015-08-17","2015","Books"

Our People's Salvation","Deb’s Dozen: For such a time as this, you will be our people’s salvation.<br /><br />For Such a Time by Kate Breslin is a thought-provoking book, which made me pause and ponder several times. The heroine in the story, Stella Muller (Hadassah), is modeled on Esther. She, too, will be the salvation of her people. Set in Theresienstadt (Terezin), the story recounts Stella’s rescue from Dachau and her journey to health and determination as the Kommandant’s secretary. Aric Schmidt, the Kommandant of Theresienstadt, is a decorated war hero to the Nazis. After being wounded in a battle against the Russians, he is rewarded with this post following his recovery. Touring Dachau, he came upon Stella on a firing squad line still holding the hand of a little girl who had just been killed by the squad. Compelled to rescue her, he takes her to his home in Theresienstadt, allows her to recover, and then uses her as his secretary.<br /><br />Providentially, her uncle, Morty, is imprisoned in the ghetto at Theresienstadt, and they are reunited. Aric does not know that Stella is really Hadassah Benjamin, but believes she is an Aryan who has been imprisoned through a mishap over her papers (which actually are false). Morty is the last of the Jewish Elders still alive there and has the gruesome task of picking the prisoners who are to go on the trains to Auschwitz. Joseph, a young Jewish boy whom the Kommandant has made his houseboy, is the go-between for Morty and Stella.<br /><br />This was a very hard story to read. I didn’t want to remember the atrocities that the Nazis inflicted upon the Jews during WWII. I didn’t want to face the hardships that they lived with on a daily basis. Perhaps the most telling scene for me was when the Kommandant forced one of his officers to eat a bowl of the “potato soup” that was being served to the Jews. The officer ate it and immediately vomited. How awful it must have been to have had to eat rotten potato soup to survive!<br /><br />After having said all that, I will still recommend that you read For Such a Time. The story, although ugly in the situation, is still a story of hope and redemption and love. You will fall in love with Stella and Joseph and Helen and ache for Morty and Leo and Yakov and the others in the ghetto. You will agonize with the Kommandant, Aric, as he tries to ascertain who he is and what he has become. For Such a Time will be that unforgettable book for you. Four stars.

She spent fifteen years as a bookseller. She loves classical movies, the outdoors and gardening. Her favorite authors are Francine Rivers, Liz Curtis Higgs, Stephanie Landsem, and Julie Garwick.<br /><br />When I interviewed her she told me she chose this topic because of a parallel story she had read about a WWII Nazi concentration camp. She had been reading Esther and asked herself if she could bring Esther’s story to “modern” times. Each chapter starts with a relevant quote from the Book of Esther.<br /><br />She has received much acclaim for For Such a Time.

If it's not going to be fired, it shouldn't be hanging there.”<br />Julie Weston’s MOONSHADOWS rises to Chekhov’s standards. Packed with rich details of history, geography, and character, MOONSHADOWS is a delightful and absorbing mystery. Nellie Burns is the perfect imperfect first-wave feminist heroine: determined to negotiate her own way—sometimes with nearly fatal results—as she faces the raw power of nature and the rough realities of frontier life in 1920s Idaho. Nellie is determined, too, to make sure the things she learns about tolerance and trust in a town that has plenty of ethnic tensions are passed on to others. Her stubborn insistence on testing her talents and courage leads her to err at times, but it is this same trait that sees her through solving the puzzle of what appears to be a double murder before she herself can be counted among the corpses.<br />And in the process, she establishes herself not only as an emerging detective, but as a gifted photographer.","2015-08-17","2015","Books"

The first book, Infinity Guantlet, from 1991 is quite a good story and highly recommended. In fact, it is still fondly remembered even today.  Less so are the Infinity sequels: Infinity War from '92, Infinity Crusade from Summer '93, and the much later (and rarer, back to the well follow up) Infinity Abyss form the early 2000s.     All are by written Infinity architect and Marvel's cosmic master storyteller, Jim Starlin. Artwork in the original Infinity Guantlet was by legend George Perez & Ron Lim of early 1990s Captain America and Silver Surfer fame. Lim also picked up art duties on War and Crusade.      Infinity Crusade opens with the Godess (the totality of good in Adam Warlock's soul) returning to our solar system to recruit many of the then-present day Marvel heroes to her cause and help eleminate all crime and evil in the universe. Sounds like a good idea right? Maybe. Read the book to find out.     All in all, I'd only give this book a 3 out of 10.  The story is fairly preachy, overdramatic, and just plain predictable times but the real killer is the artwork. In places it is so bad it's an actual detraction from the storyline. Especially in the \\""tie in\\"" issues from Warlock Chronicles, and Warlock & the Infinity Watch.      Nothing against Ron Lim, in his day he was a fine enough choice for an event book.  But judged against today's uber-detailed hyper stylized artists such as Bryan Hitch or Ed McGuiness there's just no comparison.     During the cosmic scenes I just found my mind kind of wandering off.  The scope was just kind of \\""ho-hum\\"".  The figures look stiff, and the layouts just plain boring.  Also, if you look at the anatomy and faces of book's characters they're pretty much all identical if not for their respective costumes.     On the positive side, the book contains plenty ofearly '90s grimacy, angry, clenched teeth, lots of mullets and dramatic poses thrown in for good measure!!     I never read Infinity Crusade back in the day, only picking up Infinity Guantlet and the first couple issues of Infinity War. I'd always wondered how the entire saga played out. Turns out, I wasn't really missing much.  I would only recommend this collection to completists wanting to get their hands on the full trilogy.  Your money, in my humble opinion, would be best spent elsewhere.","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

Terrible Execution.","While the educated person will see the areas where Bray has made an effort to make social commentary on gender, race, and other socioeconomic factors, the style is such that she simplifies these issues to the impediment of the commentary. A person without much experience with issues of social justice could easily misinterpret her words.<br /><br />The writing is also not on par with Bray's other works, and is fairly annoying to read. Some passages are also not very clear and it becomes hard to have a mental picture of what is happening.<br /><br />The only other thing I'll say is that Bray does a disservice to many of the characters by making them seem vapid, and generally younger than they should be. There's a vague dichotomy between the dumb pageant girls who we are expected to dislike and dismiss, and the quirky pageant girls who we are expected to root for and embrace. The book is just another case of feminism gone awry where an acceptable model of girlhood is proposed and those who do not fit are shamed.<br /><br />The only thing saving this book is the amount of diversity that it has in characters, but even this is reminiscent of token minority tropes where differences are highlighted to an almost absurd degree for the sake of humor and the roles of the minority characters in the plot are dependent on their different minority statuses.<br /><br />I would not recommend the book to anyone, really.","2015-08-17","2015","Books"

There is a second copywrite in 1951, with the same title.

The author advises readers to read one of the super short chapters each day for 40 days but if you're in a hurry, it's a very fast read either way. Matthew Kelly, whose work has probably done more to grow Catholicism than any other laymen, does so by reaching out to people in their own language and this is book is readily understandable to any Christian or even someone who knows nothing about faith. &#34;Church people'' can be off-putting to many and Kelly has a gift for reaching people in ways that seem achievable. For example, the church teaches that each and every one of us has the ability to become saints, which seems impossible and astounding to many so Kelly instead says the same thing in more relatable language, that we each have the ability to become the best version of ourselves. Kelly writes: &#34;&#34;Jesus' teachings were radically simple. Experts have a special talent for complicating things. But the stand-out genius in any field is always the person who is able to take what is incredibly complex, break it down to what is essential, and present it in a way that makes it seem simple.'' That is also the genius of this book. While the Bible was written by church founders 2,000 years ago and has been repeatedly translated and reinterpreted, Kelly writes in a simple way that even a child (or a stubborn adult) can instantly relate to.","2015-08-17","2015","Books"

So, they go over the real presence, etc, which I already know about.     I just wanted to know about the actions in this form of the Mass. Why is the priest facing away from the people? Why Latin? Why do we kneel to receive communion? Why does the priest do this or that action?    It also covers the history of the reform of the Mass over the centuries. What Popes have done what. It covers Ratzinger's concerns through all of it.     It is also a medium difficuly to read. Not too hard, but not a cake walk.    Very good book.

This author is, in many ways, a kindred spirit and one I would like to meet. Perhaps one day!<br /><br />Although well qualified to write such an account - after all she did survive the sinking of the Andrea Doria, no one person could possibly write the complete story of the loss of this ship from personal experience - if only because that person would have to have been present at every single event on both ships, as they took place. The only way, therefore, for any author to produce such a definitive account is, as I have said so many times, through research, research and yet more research.<br /><br />There are some accounts of this particular tragedy which are confined to a collection of photographs and others which seek to change facts by portraying the guilty as innocent. Elsewhere, there are versions which add nothing to the boiling pot of knowledge except to rewrite what is already known after a research confined to a limited amount of previously published information.<br /><br />In this work, however, the author was drawn inextricably to the subject through numerous conversations about the ship. She was surprised to learn that so many people either knew another survivor or of someone who had missed the sailing and was, therefore, spared the tragedy. Over time she became more involved and eventually wrote this account to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the ship's loss.<br /><br />Rarely, if ever, have I read such a complete account of the loss of any single ship and we students of shipwreck should be grateful that such a complete and honest account was finally published.<br /><br />NM","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

And much of what the reviewers of the 1880s wrote about Huck Finn was new to me.<br />  But most of the rest of the book was very murky.  I tried to comprehend what Levy was saying about minstrel shows, but never quite got it. I recall seeing a couple of minstrel shows in Lincoln, Nebraska when I was a child in the 1940s. They were entertaining and amusing, but that's all I remember of them.  If Levy was trying to make a point, I missed it--unless his point was that Twain didn't know what he was doing when he wrote Huck Finn, and all of his views on everything just gushed out onto the paper in a contradictory mix, and people have been trying to make sense of it ever since, and every critic and reviewer in every age thinks he has it figured out. If that was Levy's point, he should have stated it in clearer terms, but too much academic prose got in the way.<br />  Mr. Levy is an exhaustive researcher, so I was surprised to find out he doesn't know a steamboat captain from a pilot/helmsman.<br />I wish I could give this book a higher rating because I'm sure a lot of work went into it, but I found myself re-reading paragraphs trying to figure out if he was trying to make a point FOR something or AGAINST something.<br />  Tim Champlin, author of 37 historical novels","2015-08-17","2015","Books"

My oldest child and I have tied the strings of friendship where we mutually respect one another and have a beautiful relationship because of it. There was no physical abuse involved here either!   As with many things, I see folks take things out of context and warp a well-meaning passage or book to mean something else.   Our family has been blessed. We have more joy, laughter, singing, dancing and fun in our home than ever before. We enjoy each other's company.   Also, I should mention, they speak of breaking the will of disobedience and defiance, but never of breaking their spirit! Our children obey willingly and joyfully, not out of fear. They are still very \\""spirited\\"" children with minds of their own.   Be blessed!","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

I love Candice's style of writing and her humor.  My only criticism of this book is the ending.  Although I loved the way the story ended, it was too abrupt of an ending.  I think this book should have had a more detailed conclusion.  Don't get me wrong, I loved it, I just didn't want it to end.  I would have loved to have had about 2 more scenes to show more development to the ending of the story.  I kept checking my book to see if some of the chapters were mistakenly left out at the end.  I was thinking man, please don't tell me this book is about to end right now!  I loved the characters Rashad and Fatima. I couldn't put the book down because I wanted to know what was going to happen next.  You should definitely read this book if you are looking for a really cute romance story.

In this novel, Death has a big heart and admits that humans haunt him. This book, written for young adults, starts when a nine-year-old girl named Liesel has to say good-bye to her mother after she watches her younger brother die.  Liesell is sent to live with Hans and Rosa Hubermann, who become her foster papa and mama.<br /><br />Although this book is intended for young adults, I have to think that it would be best read by an older, young adult, as in a mature 15-20 year old, who also knows a little about WWII, or at the very least is interested in history.  Parts of it move slowly, but even the slow parts have a fantastic poetic storytelling quality.<br /><br />Overall, this was a fantastic, cleverly constructed story with characters that were well conceived and incredibly real. As an adult, I thoroughly enjoyed it; however...I'm not so sure that there are many young teenagers that would have the attention span or the patience to appreciate it as a novel read for enjoyment. In my opinion, this could have easily been a five star book, had it truly been writen as an adult story.<br />4 1/2 stars.","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

As the only part of British soil occupied by the Nazis, the Channel Islands give us a microcosm of how occupation might have been if Britain had been taken. The author utilizes first hand sources and empathetic storytelling to give us a window into a dangerous, spellbinding world.<br /><br />I liked how the author was balanced in her portrayal of the Channel Islanders. Both the collaborators and the resistors were given page time, giving us a view into both sides of the Nazi occupation. The hard reality of war comes to vivid life as well: food shortages, round-ups, life on the run, and the slave labor of the Nazi era. Enough that the reader is sucked in immediately and lives the story along with the characters.<br /><br />I liked the characters generally, though I felt there was a weird balance of the POVs that did the book a disservice. Marlene and Peter, our two fictional “leads”, are the heart of the book. Through their eyes and hearts, the reader feels like they’re experiencing the story rather than just reading it. They read like two people who get swept up into the epic that is warfare and resistance, tugging the reader along by the heartstrings.<br /><br />However, there is too much emphasis and page time given to the POVs of our historically real figures like Lucy, Suzanne, and Albert. Lucy and Suzanne play a big part in the story, taking Marlene in and being driving forces behind Resistance. They could be considered leads in the story as well. So their POVs have merit.<br /><br />However, they take up so much page time, along with other real figures, that Marlene and Peter read as secondary characters at times. Other POVs like Albert and Mary Erica were just superfluous, in my opinion. They were important figures and played a intriguing part in the history of the Nazi occupation of the Channel Islands. But for this book, they were extraneous and unneeded. Marlene and Peter’s story got lost in the shuffle of history at times which is a shame.<br /><br />The author pays attention to her history and research, which is much appreciated by this WWII history buff. I liked her incorporation of first hand sources and POVs of real historical figures. Yet, those very same POVs drown out our fictional figures, which are the heart of the story and how the reader invests themselves into the story (at least for me). So an intriguing read for the history, but needs work for the fictional stuff.were extraneous and unneeded.

After the events that unfurl throughout this incredibly perceptive novel. Judith is visiting her mother in prison. The visit is strained, their relationship is obviously difficult, their conversation is superficial, they never discuss what happened, or why. Judith will return again next month, as she has for the past eight years.<br /><br />The author then takes us back to 'Before', where the reader meets Judith and her mother as they were. Before the violent and life changing episode that has created the 'After'.<br /><br />I'm not going to tell the story of The Followers, I'll just say that it is an extremely compelling look at how the most vulnerable can be brainwashed and indoctrinated into believing what another, stronger and totally plausible person leads them to believe.<br /><br />Rebecca Wait has created a community high up on the Yorkshire Moors that is solitary and lonely, yet secure and rigid. The Ark is the place that Nathaniel has conceived to house his loyal and believing followers. Nathaniel is alluring and charismatic, his followers don't question his ideals, and if they do show the smallest sign of doubt, they will be punished. Punished by Nathaniel, but also by God.<br /><br />Judith does not trust Nathaniel and rebels from day one. However, her mother, Stephanie, soon falls under his spell. The Ark is so much better than her old life as a struggling single mother, working in a cafe with nothing to look forward to. The community in The Ark will love her and care for her, she feels needed and part of a family, she feels important and special, she is sure that Judith will get used to it.<br /><br />The Followers is an excellent read. I was totally captivated by it from the very first page. Rebecca Wait writes cleverly and with great authenticity, she gets to the heart of Nathaniel and his followers so well. She describes the control and the manipulation that can only lead to destruction in the end, Whilst the reader can clearly see what is happening, the characters are so cleverly controlled by Nathaniel that they appear blind to his faults.<br /><br />The wild Yorkshire Moors is almost a character within itself. The author's sense of place is outstanding, she creates the perfect setting for The Followers, living as they do in almost splendid isolation. The winds, the rain, the mist, all complement this story so very well, adding to the tension and the apprehension of what may be to come.<br /><br />The Followers is written simply, it is incredibly easy to read which only makes it more extraordinary in how brilliant it is. It is gripping, clever, and so brilliantly told. Another triumph for this incredibly talented young author.","2015-08-17","2015","Books"

The variety of shapes, colors, and patterns in the carvings featured in \\""The Magic Horse\\"" demonstrates that the Dala horse is much more than the familiar red-orange gift shop souvenir. For those seriously interested in Swedish folk traditions and handcrafts, this book is a valuable addition to a collector's library.

This book was great!","I was hesitant to read Lover Unbound for fear that it was not up to the quality that the earlier books in the series were.  I read through many of the reviews on Amazon and started out prepared to totally dislike the writing.  I LOVED this book.  I loved Vishous and Jane's story and in fact, Jane has replaced Bella as my favorite Shellan.      Without getting into the specifics.  JR Ward took the series in a new direction.  Getting deeper into characters that will move the series forward and drilling down more into the BDB so that the plots do not become repetitive.  Many reader reviews were a bit creeped out by the bonding/S&M take on the character of Vishous but by the middle end of the book I realized it was a perfect plot device that lent the book a great layer.  By the end of the book I felt as if V (& Jane & Butch) has transcended to another plane in their relationship and that hard core sex element faded into a footnote for me.  It was also nice to take a Lesser break as for me that is one element to her writing that is an annoyance (when they crop up in the midst of a story line or a particularly hot scene).    Did I miss elements from earlier in the series?  Heck yeah!  I sort of like knowing that in spite of being vampires, they mack out to Fiddy & Luda and I would have liked to have seen more appearances of Mary, Beth and the rest of the characters.  But I think that entering into V's world was a consuming journey and by the end of the book one is left COMPLETELY satisfied.      As for the unusual HEA for Jane and V.  Yeah its out of the ordinary but isn't that why we read these books.  For being given the chance to suspend our realities of just a bit of time is the promise of these books and Ms. Ward delivers beautifully in that area.    I look forward to John (and hopefully) Xhex's story, Payne & (I pray Rehvenge's) story, Quhinn, Blay & Dr. Manello & quite possible the continued storyline for Jane where she gets to retake a corporeal form.  I hear thatMs. Ward plans to move away from paranormal romance into the realm of Urban Fantasy.  I don't quite know what the difference is but I hope that she maintains the quality and does not move into a genre simply for titillation and sales sake.","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

Isn't that the kind of characteristics you would want in a book?  Jinx on the Divide is the third book of a trilogy.  This book uses descriptive, strong words that hook you in.  I recommend jinx on the Divide because the first two books had amazing storylines that kept you going and this book keeps it going.        If you've never read Jinx on the Divide, then you don't know how the character Felix travels to another dimension. It is set in England as Felix tries to help a genie turn into a solid being, but the genie takes a human boy as a hostage to ensure his cooperation. If the story sounds good so far then you should pickup the book and read the rest.   Jinx on the Divide contains the struggle between good and evil. I would recommend this book to the ages of 12 to 14 years because the book contains many descriptive words.  Also it is a fantasy book because some of the characters are mythical creatures and they use magic spells.   Jinx on the Divide is very similar to Back to the Divide.  They are both written by the same author and contain some of the same characters.   In Jinx on the divide, Felix tries to help a genie become solid, but in back to the Divide, Felix tries to save his parents form being turned to stone for ever.   Jinx on the Divide had many strengths. First, the prologue with in the book helps recap where the last book left off and to help you remember the last books ending incase you never read the book before. Second, the author uses different names for the mythical creatures like an elf was called a tangle child and a pixie was called a japegrin. Third, the author finishes the book in a way where you think it will continue in to another book, but it can't because of the last event. Lastly, the author makes the characters interact in a way that makes you feel like you are right next to them.   In conclusion, Jinx on the Divide turned out to be an amazing story.  The plot is perfect, thewords are as descriptive as possible, and the characters are beyond imaginable. I hope if you read this review you will by this book and enjoy it.","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

How did they end up disbursed throughout the world and always seemed to be in the middle to upper middles classes? Why was there such a concentration of Jews amongst the world's moneylenders and bankers? These questions have been asked for many years, if not centuries and this book offers its own theory as to why and how this came to be. This book takes a somewhat different tack as it is written by two economists who apply current economic theories to try and understand Jewish history over the past two millennia.<br /><br />Their theory boils down to an observation that the Jewish people decided to focus on literacy as the key element of their religious practices and developed primary education for all boys and many girls as well. This focus on literacy allowed them to capture opportunities that arose when the population shifted from purely agrarian pursuits to urban environments with a heavy reliance on trade. Farmers did not need to be literate to be able to properly farm their lands and would actually pay a higher price if their children did not help in farming chores since they were studying. Add to this the costs of the education and these economists point out that economic theory predicts that there must have been something of value to have the Jewish people focus on literacy. In turn, these skills helped them take advantage of opportunities that required those skills as a base and therefore the Jews were best positioned, as a people, to move into trade, crafts, medicine, scholarship, and money-lending (i.e. banking).<br /><br />The book covers the time period from the destruction of the Second Temple in AD 70, to 1492 which was the height of the European expulsion of Jews from Spain, buy came at the end of several waves of expulsions throughout Europe. Tracing this timeline, the authors describe the history and population distribution of the Jews, as well as the rise and fall of various population measures. Comparing these to the equivalent movements among non-Jews the authors point out why their theory explains these various movements and therefore provides a more satisfactory explanation that any other posited up till now.<br /><br />Before the destruction of the temple, the Jewish people were mostly illiterate farmers who relied on a small cadre of high priests for their religious guidance. This was identical in all respects to every other community of that time with the exception of the Jews believing in the existence of only one god. Of course, there were many sects amongst the Jews at that time - some of which are described as Christians. Once the temple was destroyed, that pillar of faith was gone and the remaining sects either demanded a closer adherence to the Torah through study, or relaxed their strictures on what it meant to be a Jew. This latter movement led to Paul's teaching which took Christianity in a completely different direction so that it became its own separate religion, rather than a Jewish Sect. The Jews focused on the requirement that each father must educate his sons to read the Torah and learn a craft. No other religion or sect required this. To allow this to happen, the leaders of the Jewish community created a system of primary and secondary schools where Jewish children could go to study in each Jewish community. The costs for this were born by the Jews themselves as well as the opportunity costs when the children could not perform other work as they were studying. These extra costs caused two things to happen: First, The Jewish people were well positioned to take advantage of commercial opportunities which started arising in the large Muslim empire of the early 7th century. And secondly, those Jews who could not afford these costs, or were not committed enough to bear them, moved away from Judaism and converted to Christianity or Islam - religions that were much less demanding.<br /><br />The Jews also self-selected. Those who could not, or would not, learn to read and study were shunned by those Jews who could with restrictions of association and marriage made on them. This further alienated those Jew would did not learn to read and that pushed them away from the one religion on to another. That is the reason why - the authors claim - that in some cases Jewish populations shrank by 50 to 90 percent while the other peoples they resided amongst shrank by significantly smaller percentages. This is in contrast to the commonly accepted theory that Jews were slaughtered or forced to convert. The authors point out that while there were certainly events of such type over the years, they cannot explain the huge falls in Jewish numbers, while a willing conversion due to dire economic conditions does. This always seemed to happen when the society of the time was hit by a large extraneous shock that caused that society to go back to a more subsistence agrarian basis than before. The two main such waves are the times right after the various Jewish revolts in the first century AD, and right after the Mongol invasion of the Middle East which effectively destroyed the rich and vast Muslim empire.<br /><br />Since this is an economic study, it is written carefully with some economic jargon mixed in. There are also annexes to chapters that present the mathematical underpinnings of some of the points made in those chapters. In other words, this is not a light reading book. As it happens, I did take it with me on a beach vacation, which was not a good move, as this book requires reflection and concentration to really understand the message. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it and am looking forward to the followup book which the authors promise. This next one is supposed to cover the time from 1492 to the present day and will deal with another major shock to Jewish life- the Holocaust.so self-selected.

A combination of fantasy and brutal reality, pretend worlds and very everyday now. A 7 (about to turn 8) year old girl and her eccentric (to put it mildly) grandmother, live by their own rules while their mother/daughter holds a responsible, uninteresting job at the local hospital. Grandmother enlists Elsa in her antics and Elsa is a willing henchman while Granny helps to offset the bullying Elsa experiences regularly at school.<br /><br />Granny has created a world through stories, a world that is both complex and simple, the Land-of-Almost-Awake. This land has it's own structure, myths, heroes and villains and offers some rules that can help in Elsa's world. She has also set Elsa with a project, to deliver messages to people in Granny's life. And she has provided Elsa with guardians and warriors. What the ultimate story is, what the ultimate task is all about, you must read to find out.<br /><br />And I do strongly recommend that you read this. It was one of the most enjoyable reading experiences I've had this year. It offers a story which centers on a child without being childish; it has elements of fantasy while ultimately being grounded in this world. And it has some wonderfully complex characters.<br /><br />A copy of this book was provided by the publisher through NetGalley in return for an honest review.","2015-08-17","2015","Books"

Chapters vary in interest but this no doubt depends on where the reader is coming from. I've reread several chapters and enjoyed the familiar down-under feel of these lives.     Most are fascinating reflections on the random paths taken through  life, and how a passion for learning overcame all sorts of obstacles, namely the common Aussie /Kiwi issue  of lack of money.     Many, but not all, started from similar small town backgrounds, did well enough to get Teacher Scholarships to University and took off from there, a not uncommon path in the 50's and 60's.   As a New Zealander who did my Geography Masters many years ago I particularly enjoyed Peter Holland's re-engagement, after 20 years away, with his childhood landscape of South Canterbury; Warren Moran on his path from a North Auckland childhood to teaching in French Canada to a focus on the political geography of agriculture and wine; and WAV Clark on his career long search to answer the seemingly simple question of why people live where they do.    Others will have their own favourites.  Buy this if you are interested in the recent evolution of geography & geographers and find the lifepaths of individual academics as interesting as the subject itself.

I do warn, however, that her approach may not please everyone.  History buffs who prefer the traditional, linear approach to history or just those who do not enjoy Vowell's public radio persona may simply not enjoy this book.

It is creative and beautifully written.  So why only 3 stars?  Because the author chose to mix this potentially great fantasy with silly, and often contradictory, New Age philosophy.<br />  I often found myself frustrated by how little sense the decisions of the characters made.  There were also many moments that were supposed to be times of \\""great revelation\\"" that were later contracted.  One such moment was when Merlinus had a great epiphany about Christianity and how important it's new \\""I am my brother's keeper\\"" philosophy is to the world.  Sounds nice right?  Except that that is as much a Jewish philosophy as much as a Christian one.  After all, that line is from the Old Testament, not the New.  Still, Whats that matter?  It matters because it later turns out that the Druids are, in fact, descended from the Hebrew Priesthood themselves.  So why don't the Druids already teach the Celts to \\""Be thy brother's keeper\\""?  We never get an answer to this.<br />  Another such contradiction came in how the Celtic holy men were protrayed compared to the Christian holy men.  According to Merlinus, Christianity is the future, Pagans the past.  Only the Angels' \\""nailed god\\"" can stand against Odin and the forces of chaos.  And yet Christian holy men are portrayed as blind fools.  The Druids are great sages that know the secrets of the world beyond our senses.  If the Druids are so great, why can't they stop the forces of Chaos?<br />  Towards the end of the book there was also a strange event where Uther, A Christian, was going through the countryside slaughtering those pagans that wouldn't convert.  I did not understand why his wife Ygrane, a devout Pagan Witch, did not object!  Confusing.<br />  All in all, I WOULD suggest you read this book.  I really enjoyed how the author meshed science with fantasy.  But it could have been alot better.","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

This story is wholly original and different from any of the games and follows the story of two different princes from different eras whose lives parallel on contrast each other in different ways.  The art is pretty good and clean and easy to follow.  However the story is kind of convoluted with the way these two eras overlap eachother, and the way characters are introduced it's hard to tell which story the character is affecting.  Which was probably intentional, but just made it difficult for a fool like me to read.  I think the best part is the section in the back (that has concept art with it), where the designer of the Prince of Persia series discusses ideas he put into the first game and how the character was remade by so many different people that there is no one \\""true\\"" prince, and that this story reflects that in a very unique way.","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

It is written for kids in a kid-friendly style, but it has great ideas that anyone can do including adults.     My nephews were looking over the book last night and they like the idea about taking paper lunch bags, decorating them, and putting inside each of them a juice box and a (imperishable) snack of some sort.  Then taking the bags to a shelter for kids there to grab whenever they need an afterschool or nighttime snack.  Of course, as the book instructs, a parent needs to call ahead and explain the plan before you put it into action.    I'm happy with the layout, the wording, the simplicity, and - of course - the actual ideas.    LOVE IT!","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

However, have you ever witnessed a teacher arrested during a quiz? In the book Prom, written by Laurie Halse Anderson, Ashley Hannigan witnesses her senior high math teacher, Miss. Crane, arrested for stealing money from the prom committee.  Prom committee chairperson Natalia was Ashley's best friend. She had wanted Ashley tot go to prom, however Ashley hated the thought of prom, dressing up didn't appeal to her; at all. Although, her mother was excited about the opportunity to pick out the perfect prom dress for her daughter, In conclusion, Ashley after helping her best friend had the time of her teenage life and an unforgettable life experience at prom.     \\""Mean Girls\\"" the movie have similarities and differences to Book \\""Prom\\"" by Laurie Halse Anderson. The similarities are, they are both set in High School the issues of prom or dance high school aged kids can be the highlight and is trying to fit in and get prepared for their magical night. A few differences from the book and movie are the movie Mean Girls is set in their sophomore year in high school and in the movie they have a dance. In the book Prom they are in their senior year and the teenagers are having a senior prom. In conclusion if you like the movie \\""Mean Girls\\"", then you will definitely like the book \\""Prom\\"" by Laurie Halse Anderson.   Girls ages 13-16 will love the book \\""Prom\\"". This book is telling girls who have not had your senior prom, to watch out for the evil math teachers who want to steal the prom money...just kidding. This book will tell girls how hard it is to plan their senior prom, with a lot of hard work and dedication; prom will be the night of your life. Prom is and will be the one of those life moments that you will never forget.   Some of the things I like about the book \\""Prom\\"", the author Laurie writes the book like we are exactly in Ashley Hannigans body because it feels like wecan telepathically hear Ashley, think and here what she says when no one is there. The second strength I have about the book is that the author adds teenage problems and emotions to the story like breakups and make up with boyfriends. Third strength that I have is that the book has lots of details like when Ashley laughs or cries the author describes all of those feelings. The fourth and final strength is how Ashley and her mother are so close because it is funny and emotional to read about the funny and sad things they say to each other.   All in all, my option about this book is great and I would totally recommend it to all my friends.","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

Most end up explaining some principles of photography (I don't want to consider whether photography has rules; if so, they are easily broken!) and indicating one can be more creative by applying these rules. Harold Davis is one of the few authors I've encountered who aims at changing the photographer rather than just improving technique.<br /><br />Davis uses ideas that have been generated and proven by modern management and psychology teaching. The book is a two-parter; part one is a discussion of the steps that a photographer can take to increase his or her creativity, and part two is a workbook, with exercises that provide practical work applying what was learned in part one.<br /><br />Unfortunately making the program work requires a lot of effort on the part of the reader-photographer. For example, the author tells you to form specific goals for improvement of your photography, based on a self-evaluation of where you are now. But the author can't specify the goals for the particular photographer. That has to come from within the individual photographer, and it can be an arduous task, but the payoff will be high.<br /><br />Since this isn't a simple process, like learning how depth of field works (which the author does mention) I would expect that the reader may read the book in a couple of sittings, but will have to work at the exercises for a long time, and probably over and over. Most of the work will have to come from the reader.<br /><br />The book is profusely illustrated with the author's excellent photographs. I did wonder if the fact that so many of them involved composites or refined techniques might lead readers to believe that such techniques were essential to developing creativity. Yet I felt certain that Davis would agree that an individual could become more creative within an established genre.<br /><br />My only objection to the book is that the author often referred to the concept of &#34;Resistance&#34;, an idea presented by Stephen Pressfield in &#34;[[ASIN:1936891026 The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles]]&#34;. I found that book, emphasizing how the artist is continually at war with him or herself to create art, to be a far cry from the author's positive message that we can improve our creativity by approaching it in a reasonable and logical manner, with enough effort. On the other hand, I enjoyed the author's incorporation of the ideas of Joseph Campbell, particularly since Davis is the guide on our journey.<br /><br />I suspect not everyone will get a bump in creativity from reading this book. But the benefits to be gained, especially if one is willing to work on one's creativity, certainly merit giving the Davis approach a shot.concept of &#34;Resistance&#34;, an idea presented by Stephen Pressfield in &#34;[[ASIN:1936891026 The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles]]&#34;.

A mistake that her father the vicar refuses to forgive, a mistake that causes her sister to despise her, a mistake that sends her to a temporary home for unwed mothers. The man who contributed to her situation, Edward, had no intention of doing the honorable thing by marrying her, not when he could marry her cousin and gain a fortune. She is alone in this world, until she meets an old suitor, Dr. Daniel Taylor, who is battling his own demons. Daniel is married to a woman who suffers from manic depression due to her pregnancy. He loves his wife and remains faithful to her, but still has feelings for Charlotte. Charlotte is unable to keep her darling son and makes the ultimate sacrifice that any mother would dread to make: she gives away her son to the very man who so cruelly slighted her. Meanwhile, Mrs. Taylor gives birth to a little girl who they name Anne. His wife is unable and considers it beneath her to nurse her daughter, so Charlotte steps in as the baby's wet nurse and nanny. The awkward situation continues even a little while after his wife does better, at least until Charlotte feels that it is time for her to move on. She takes a different position as a wet nurse for another couple but doesn't hold that occupation for very long. Mrs. Taylor is pregnant again and in a drastic attempt to return to her country, she dies. To help her old friend, Charlotte returns to caring for Anne as if she were her own daughter. When the proper time of mourning passes, Daniel proposes to Charlotte, but she refuses because her soul still needs healing after what she experienced. A few years pass, Edward's wife dies and it only makes sense to him that he should make Charlotte his wife, that way she could finally be a true mother to her son.   I swear, no matter how many times I read \\""The Lady of Milkweed Manor,\\"" I always end up crying like a baby. Then ending is bittersweet and everything you could hope for for Charlotte. The Christian message is subtle and not at all preachy. While Charlotte loves her son with all her heart, she regrets her mistake and is humbled through out the story. In the flashbacks she is shown as a carefree and innocent girl, after her \\""fall\\"" she matures into a strong, independent young woman. I also admire the character Daniel Taylor; here is a man who loves and is attracted to another woman other than his wife, but there is no place in the story where he cheats on his wife or treats Charlotte with any impropriety.   Julie Klassen's newest book, \\""The Apothecary's Daughter\\"" is out in the bookstores now and I eagerly am waiting (not so patiently) until I can read it.  [...]","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

To be ordained as a presbyterian minister from a liberal seminary, and to live life walking gingerly through these bastions of pompous intellectualism avoiding persecution, not willing to confront these strongholds, are truly not the earmarks of a born again defender of the faith.  Faith in Jesus Christ (the Word) is not an intellectual pursuit, it is a spiritual pursuit.  The Lord said, \\""Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.\\"" John 3:7  Can you intellectualize your way to that child-like faith the Lord spoke of?  \\""Seek and ye shall find\\"", begins with putting away everything you hold dear, and putting the Lord first, above all.  Dear poor old Fred has had a long and illustrious career according to this world, but how will that stack up with the true defenders of the faith in the next world... the martyrs, the saints that gave all?  Poor dear Fred is still plagued by doubts for this very reason. \\""Love not the world, neither the things [that are] in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\\"" 1 John 2:15  I would allow for the possibility that dear Fred uses doubt as a literary device, except for the fact that this is supposedly a collection of his best sermons, and the subject of doubt comes up way too often.  I would not recommend this work as a piece for the budding evangelist to seek guidance and to be lifted it up.  If your desire is to seek and save the lost, rely on the Word of God, and leave ramblings such as these alone. The doctrine of Fred is woefully lacking, only the doctrine of Christ found in the inspired Word, brings about the fellowship needed to bolster faith, and win souls. \\""But without faith [it is] impossible to please [Him]: for he that cometh to God must believe that He is, and [that] He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.\\"" Hebrews 11:6<br />In His service,<br />by His mercy and grace,<br />Porter<br />+++[that] He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.\\"" Hebrews 11:6   In His service,   by His mercy and grace,  Porter  +++","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

For the most part, we spent several weeks each in Hanoi, Saigon, Hoi An, and Sapa; not only did this guide provide just about everything we needed to know to get started in each locale, but as we explored on our own, it seemed like whatever we discovered was also consistently found in the guide. One key example of this guide's excellence: at the time, it was the only guide that guided travelers to the Ha An Hotel in Hoi An, by far the nicest place to stay in town (and very affordable as well). Over the weeks we stayed there, the Lonely Planet hordes were completely clueless about the place. That's the thing: Lonely Planet is great, but it seemed like 90% of travelers we saw had the LP guide tucked under their arms, so think about what that means for you--if you choose to join the LP stampede, or step to the side of it with this comprehensive guide.

When strange things start happening at her off-campus dorm--Nightingale Hall, a secluded brick house that shares the series' ominous monicker--Jessica learns her room is the one in which former student Giselle McKendrick hanged herself. But was Giselle's death really a suicide, as the campus officials claimed?    I don't know about you, but I've got chills.    Okay, not really. But when I was eleven, and my best friend Shawna loaned me this book to read, I did.    Of course, back then I was more apt to overlook such annoyances as the glittery prose used to describe the protagonist, her shiny hair, and her navy-blue eyes, or the ellipses...that plague...almost every...paragraph..    (What was the deal with the early nineties that everything had to be all neon and spandex and adjectives every other word? Seriously.)    Bottom line: I was happy to see how well this story had held up over time. Is there better YA fiction out there today? You bet. But there's still something very special about Hoh's work.","2008-12-22","2008","Books"

Banville is an author who requires long periods of recuperation for his readers between books. A few weeks ago, I reviewed the beautiful Everyman edition of Banville's THE BOOK OF EVIDENCE and THE SEA. Coming to him then, after a gap of several years, I was struck how well his florid gourmet style played against his subjects in each case, the one justifying the other. But this time, the style seems merely self-indulgent, and the story -- a warming-over of all-too-familiar tropes -- quite insufficient to justify it.<br /><br />Style, first. Here's the end of one paragraph from early in the book and the start of the one following:<br /><br />&#34;…But that's not nature, strictly speaking, is it? What, then? It's the all, the omnium, that I'm thinking of; the whole kit and boodle, mice and mountain ranges, and us, wedged in between, the measure of all things, God bless the mark, as they say in these parts. // There's nothing to eat in the house. What am I to do? I could go out into the wood, I suppose, and forage for sweet herbs, or delve for pig nuts, whatever they are.…&#34;<br /><br />He's a wizard with words, no mistake. And there are times when he says something that is not merely clever but actually penetrating, as when he describes love as &#34;being let into a place that she had been hitherto alone in.&#34; But usually you are just aware of the dexterity of his word-juggling, his fondness for obscure words: &#34;the borborygmic blarings of a three-piece band&#34; for example. And then there are the give-aways: &#34;as they say in these parts&#34; (not for the past 60 years they haven't) or &#34;pig nuts, whatever they are&#34; (if you don't know, why say it?). It gets exhausting very quickly.<br /><br />And who is this monomaniac bent on enthralling us with his confessional monologue? Another of Banville's stock characters, an over-cultured middle-aged failure, Oliver Otway Orme, former painter and petty thief, offering us his memories of childhood, false-modest glimpses of his sexual escapades, and a meditation on his sorry state generally. Somewhere in there are would-be-profound thoughts on the act of appropriation, the way the artist and the pilferer both take from their surroundings, but I couldn't be bothered to disentangle them. All I saw was a pathetic adulterer describing an affair with his best friend's wife, glorifying both his lust and his cowardly desertion as though it were some Roman de Geste. His ability to put his navel-gazing into flowery language does not make the lint any more edifying.is sexual escapades, and a meditation on his sorry state generally.
