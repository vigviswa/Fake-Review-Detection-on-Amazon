Sam MacDonald is in his late 20s when the life that he's always enjoyed (drinking, hanging out, not really caring about money) comes to a grinding halt when he discovers how much money he owes to the IRS and credit card companies. He decides to try an \\""urban hermit\\"" plan for month, where he exists on the cheapest food possible (tuna, eggs and lentils) while saving up money to pay his creditors back. Unlike a lot of other memoirs where the author decides to follow some self-improvement plan for a year, MacDonald originally plans on being an urban hermit for only a month. Due to a series of unforeseen events, he ends up being an urban hermit (with some breaks) for many, many months. During that time, we see him travel to Bosnia for a reporting job, bust a porn shop for illegal viewing booths, save a trailer park, travel to a huge hippie gathering in Montana, get what sounds like his first real girlfriend, and various other adventures. MacDonald's style of writing is perfect for a book like this, and he has a way of describing situations and scenes that will make you laugh out loud. The parts where he is attempting to cook the lentils and traveling to Montana in a VW Bus are particularly funny. If you are from Maryland or the DC area, you will enjoy familiar sights being mentioned in the book.     The book around 280 pages, but is a very fast read. MacDonald is a sympathetic, likeable character and his discipline is admirable. One warning - because I know some people don't like this - there is a fair amount of drug use in the book, so if you are squeamish about that, be forewarned. If you don't care, then dive right in!","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

The author challenges the fact that Jesus rose from the dead and that he was actually the son of god or that he was a product of a miracle birth. He also outlines how crucifixions were done and his perception of how Jesus was crucified leads to his theory that Jesus was not resurrected from the dead. Very bold theory in the climate of Christian religion; however, the author's views can not necessarily erase a Christian's faith but certainly raises questions. In that, I find the book very interesting particularly as the author analyzes the words of the Apostles, offers challenges and compares there writings to history. One example is King Herod; historians have no record of him ordering the death of all new borns in any period, which lends itself to legend versus fact. Aside from the writings of the Apostles, particularly Luke, Mathew and John; the greater portion of the second half of the book focuses on Paul, an early convert, who through his evangelistic travels establishes Christian churches all along the Mediterranean. The author offers that Christ, including the original Apostles, did not intend to create a new religion but intended to refocus the Jewish religion on a more charitable basis towards the disadvantaged and spread a mission of peace while Paul, in conflict with the Apostles choose, to establish a new religion, embracing Jews but more aggressively and successfully gentiles, based on Jesus Christ and the Holy Trinity. This is a controversial book, but a challenging book, well written and very educational while utilizing the words of the Apostles and in great detail, Paul's. The author also references various time periods of when the various letters and epsitles were written as hinted in references in those documents. The contents are very educatuional about the life of paul, the period, Jesus, the Apostles, the Romans, the Jewisk Messiah and so much more.In my view, it can only wet your appetite for a more serious study of the bible and religions in general, not a bad thing at all.al about the life of paul, the period, Jesus, the Apostles, the Romans, the Jewisk Messiah and so much more.In my view, it can only wet your appetite for a more serious study of the bible and religions in general, not a bad thing at all.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

Eliot's 1948 'Notes Towards the Definition of Culture.' Both Llosa and Eliot believe culture is in a deep crisis and in decline. 'Culture' varies between and within societies, determined by the economic conditions and prevalent religion. The idea that, through education, one can transmit a consistent culture to all society through education is both naïve and detrimental to real culture - the latter because the only way this can be accomplished is by making culture more superficial than ever. The main form for transmitting culture through generations is via the family, secondarily through the Church - not education.<br /><br />The most obvious examples of deteriorating culture - popular music -&#62; rap, the spread of tattoos, animalistic dancing, sliding respect for education, etc. receives surprising little attention.<br /><br />If people were better educated, they'd be more worthy of democracy. If capitalism were less venal, then perhaps the cultural world would be less populated by those with mediocre/zero talent but bright and flamboyant. Entertainment has replaced depth. Culture used to mean high culture, but today it's pop culture, black culture, youth culture - special cultures everywhere. Kant's philosophy is considered equal to Kim Kardashian's posterior. Replacing Orson Welles is Woody Allen. He's amazed at the existence of classroom masturbation workshops and those who think this is progress -supposedly the aim is to reduce unwanted and premature pregnancies, but the effect is to further trivialize sex and dissociate it from passion.<br /><br />Some interesting points - however, it's tempting to alternatively just dismiss him as a grouchy old man who doesn't like change.","2015-08-13","2015","Books"

This author has not done his homework prior to embarking upon the exercise of building his new world.  Science fiction allows an author to create a world of his or her choosing; however, a fanatic attention to detail is required in order to prevent the story from being merely a cautionary tale retold in artificial surroundings.  Good science fiction does not allow a huge group of people to simply be ditched in subways with no means of support--heavens, this is a vast country.<br /><br />Civilization is far too nuanced to be simply rewritten in a couple introductory pages.  The seeds of some fine writing are present in this book but the attention to detail was lacking.  Fine science fiction has a depth--you can pierce the surface and find an infinite wealth of detail; likewise in the fantasy genre.  The worlds created by J.R.R. Tolkien and Frank Herbert are fantastic and strange but consistent.  Age of the Conglomerates was just not consistent; like episodic television, it placed its characters, stated its plot and ground to the inevitable conclusion.<br /><br />Our author had the admirable goal of showing the importance of family ties, of demonstrating the dangers of profligate government, he warns of the real consequences of placing immediate concerns above regard for the future.  He has much to say about the potential dangers of genetic science and the fragility of our economy--but this story did his worthy ideas a disservice.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

The book, with its photographs, is a window to a world that most Americans never see, and cannot even imagine.  Mortenson's mission (and yes, it is a mission), is to change the world for the better by doing whatever is necessary to educate girls and boys in this unstable region of the world.  Some disagree:<br /><br />\\""Mortenson's repeated pleas not to lump all Muslims together, and his arguments for a multipronged attack on terror - the need to educate Muslim children, rather than just dropping bombs - hit a nerve with a nation newly at war.  For the first time in his life, Mortenson found himself opening envelope after envelope of hate mail... Mortenson opened dozens of similar unsigned letters until he became too depressed to keep reading.  'That night, for the first time since starting my work in Pakistan, I thought about quitting,' he says.  'I expected something like this from an ignorant village mullah, but to get those kinds of letters from my fellow Americans made me wonder whether I should just give up'\\"" (p. 275).<br /><br />He didn't.<br /><br />But Mortenson missed an important point here.  He was distressed to be getting these hate letters from EDUCATED Americans.  There is a limit to what you can expect from \\""education\\"".  There are many, well-educated messengers of hate.  Osama bin Laden is rumored to have a degree in civil engineering, and Ayman Muhammad Rabaie al-Zawahiri has his degrees in medicine.  There are a number of suicide bombers with educations.  What is to be done with these people or their ilk as the girls in Mortenson's schools are being educated?<br /><br />The world is a complicated place.  Luckily, there are people like Mortenson who are putting their lives and savings on the line to keep trying new models to develop peaceful communities and relationships.  There are other models as well.  A fault of Three Cups Of Tea is that it comes across as if Mortenson's model is THE model.<br /><br />It isn't.

The author goes on to describe each of the Gods' attributes and how they relate to character types found in literature and film.  She also explores how the various character types interact with one another.  The final section of the book explores two archetypal story outlines - the Feminine Journey and the Masculine Journey.  These are actually quite useful templates to help an author design his own plot outline, and are illuminated by the author's comparisons to well-known examples from literature.  On the whole, I would say this is a good book for a beginning author to read in his quest to write compelling drama.  Give it a read, and judge for yourself...","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

It is for good reason any reader with a critical eye starts out early noticing the  implausibility of this book, as we shall soon see. [[ASIN:1420879979 Head-Hunter One Kilo! 173rd Airborne Brigade, Vietnam 1968-69, Sky Soldiers]] Supposedly, Lenox Cramer grew up on the rough streets of Detroit, Michigan. It states in this book that as a teenager  Cramer fought with a member of a motorcycle gang that bothered him and demanded that he pay for protection. Cramer shot the gang member in the leg, was arrested and promptly sent to a juvenile detention center. As Cramer related: \\""Dad made a deal with the judge. In return for a clean slate, I would enlist in the Army for three years.\\"" Serving for three years with the 173rd Airborne Brigade, and then joining the Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol element of the 173rd, he finished out his tour and returned to the U.S. shortly after the Tet Offensive of January, 1968.<br /><br />Why did Cramer decide to go back and become a Green Beret?  Cramer wrote upon returning from Vietnam: \\""Outside the perimeter fence of the airbase, a huge crowd carried signs on sticks. Most were dressed in multicolored clothes. Their signs read \\""peace\\"", \\""love\\"" and something about baby killers. As our buses pulled out of the front gate of the base, the people in the colorful clothes went crazy. Raw eggs splattered the bus. [[ASIN:0743464990 Reflections of a Warrior: Six Years as a Green Beret in Vietnam]] Since it was late summer and hot, most of the soldiers had opened their windows. Everything that was being thrown by the crowd came into the bus, hitting the guys that were fresh out of the killing grounds. The Green Beret sitting next to me said that these people were hippie war protesters. A couple of them ran up to the bus and threw bags at us. The bags were filled with human feces.\\"" How tragic it was to treat returning soldiers that had just put their lives on the line in the defense of democracy and this country. Once back in the real world of mundane civilian life, Cramer realized that he enjoyed war, killing, and the rush that went with it.<br /><br />Choosing to reenlist, Cramer wrote: \\""I knew there was nothing for me in the U.S. at that time. The only real ties I had to anyone or anything was in the Special Forces. I was one of their professionals now, like it or not. And the bulk of professional soldiers were where the action was, in 'Nam. I was a highly trained killer. I belonged in 'Nam, with men like myself who would accept me for who and what I was right then. When I returned to Ft. Bragg, I volunteered for the 5th Special Forces Group, Vietnam.\\"" [[ASIN:1591143217 Black Ops, Vietnam: An Operational History of MACVSOG]] Cramer claims he was a part of covert operations into countries we were not supposed to be in (Laos and Cambodia), assassinations of undesirables, i.e. both American and Vietnamese, both Southern and Northern. Cramer also wrote that he had involvement with the Central Intelligence Program in the war effort  Cramer initially qualifies this book as fiction. He explains: \\""This is a work of fiction. It is based on my experiences while serving in Southeast Asia. The names, dates, times and places have been changed to protect the innocent and the guilty alike, as well as to protect me from violating any National Security Act.\\""<br /><br />The author continues his qualification; \\""To the best of my knowledge, all of the missions of the Studies and  Observations Group (SOG) are still classified. Everything has been kept as close to fact as possible, even the gist of conversations. Special Forces operatives were the finest the Army had to offer during the S.E. Asian conflict. They paid for their courage, training, dedication, skill and motivation with blood, wounds, death and ultimately the loss of the cause for which they had so valiantly fought. Still, they fought it well. For us, the warriors, it was our \\""raison d'etre\\"", or as the Japanese warrior-mystics put it, \\""The mission is everything.\\"" We danced the slow dance on the killing grounds, to the tune called by others, obedient to the end.\\"" Cramer made some very important observations about the camaraderie of \\""SOG.\\"" that unparalleled any other military group. Cramer explained; \\""There was a bond, a camaraderie among those men that is nearly unparallel elsewhere. The green beret became our bond, our symbol. We knew we could depend on each other, no matter what. And everyone else was suspect. The CIA were treacherous, the grunts or infantry soldiers were sloppy, the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) were undependable, and the North Vietnamese Army wasthe enemy. All of them could get you killed. Green Hats, on the other hand, were friends.\\""<br /><br />Other books echo this. One in particular, \\""Across The Fence-The Secret War In Vietnam\\"" by John S. Meyer basically echo's similar sentiments. Stryker wrote: \\""You can't tell your girlfriend, your mother, no one. If anyone asked about our assignments, we were to simply say that we were with the 5th Special Forces Group in Vietnam. The agreement was binding for 20 years. If anyone violated this agreement, that individual could face federal prosecution, resulting in stiff fines and incarceration, and ruin any future government or security employment opportunities. We were prohibited from writing anything about the operation, forbidden from keeping diaries, taking photos, making drawings or tape recording notes of any sort. No identification papers (on SOG members), no dog tags, no diaries. Everyone would wear sterile fatigues, with no company insignia, no nametags, no unit designators or combat infantry badges. Why? Because Laos and Cambodia were neutral, the U.S. Government could publicly proclaim that the U.S. respected that \\""neutrality\\"". [[ASIN:0983256705 Across The Fence - The Secret War In Vietnam: Expanded Edition]] Thus, if we were killed in Laos, Cambodia or North Vietnam, the U.S. Government would deny having anything to do with us. The U.S. Government would explain that no Americans were stationed in Laos or Cambodia, which was technically accurate. The U.S. Government had \\""plausible deniability\\"" if we were captured or killed.\\""<br /><br />Stryker's book is a historical memoir. Is Cramer's? The author  has several stories of being deep in enemy territory grabbing important human targets with fellow SOG members. These stories are very similar to ones found in John L. Plaster's book \\""SOG.\\"" Plaster asserts; \\""The SOG mission that most demanded ingenuity and audacity was snatching enemy prisoners. By hook and crook, by trickery and device, by technology and technique, SOG men aspired to perfect their kidnapping craft, developing more skill in this artful science than at any time in previous military history. Rewards and accolades were heaped upon successful snatchers, and with good reason: there is no intelligence source so fruitful as a freshly snatched prisoner. [[ASIN:1609103998 BRIGHT LIGHT: Untold Stories of the Top Secret War in Vietnam]] Taking a prisoner meant a free R & R to Taiwan aboard a SOG Blackbird on a maintanence rotation, a $100 cash bonus for each American and a new Seiko wristwatch and cash to each Nung or Montegnanrd. A snatch meant initiating contact in dangerous areas, against forces that usually outnumbered your team. And when you grabbed someone, the prisoner slowed your pace while other NVA chased all the harder, knowing you had one of their own.\\""<br /><br />Finally, Cramer writes about laying secret motion sensors in the ground that detected enemy movement deep in hostile territory. This was an innovation of the Vietnam War, a technology that is now commonplace.  Cramer's description of his view of the Vietnam War sounds credible and realistic.  Cramer explained: \\""Nam was a rock 'n' roll kind of war. It seemed incongruous to me that professional killers like us were rocking to the same music as the hippies, who obviously hated us. But a lot of the younger green hats were. [[ASIN:0741420457 The Saigon Zoo: Vietnam's Other War: Sex, Drugs, Rock 'n Roll]] And when I say I was \\""into\\"" rock, I mean to the point that I could name every song on any given album, knew the words to most of them by heart and knew the name of every band member for every band I liked and their history. All of us had our little vices, but they were never talked about as long as they didn't interfere with our performance on a mission. I drank, smoked weed on occasion and ate benzedrine in the field when I needed it. It was issued to us. Some of the others did the same and some didn't. As long as I didn't get drunk on a mission, light a joint in the field or become addicted to anything other than the combat itself, no one cared what I did to survive between ops. It was an unwritten rule of the war.\\""<br /><br />The violence in this book is extremely brutal and graphic, and it is questionable as to whether this was intentionally played up to insure credibility. Why do I say this? It is a fact that time distorts all stories. The Vietnam War ended in January of 1973 for America. That is almost forty years ago, enough time for someone to take this conflict and sadly twist the truth of it for their own financial gain, and this seems to be the case in this instance.

I have read these works and recommended them to others.  However, after reading 'Jesus: A Story of Enlightenment,' I have concluded that fiction(or long parable) is not Chopra's long suit.  His attempt to fantasize what the hidden adult years of Jesus' life was like before his ministry is unconvincing. The characters of Jesus, Mary of Magdala, and Judas the Zealot are so two-dimensional and the plot so thin that a reader hoping to find a plausible 'story' or 'inspiration' will not only be disappointed, but will soon be irritated by the improbabilty and lack of meaning.  For believing Christians, this Jesus is simply an unrecognizable magus.  The narrator, who is himself an old magus(or guru) in the mountins of west Asia, discovers Jesus buried in snow, warms him up, and then learns and recounts Jesus' story of his coming to recognize his 'special powers.'  The essence of what Chopra has to say is in the final fifty pages, although the themes are not significantly different from his other works where he deals with the life and relevance of Jesus.  In summary, this is a rather poor attempt at a fictional account of an unknowable period of the life of Jesus.  The reader would better spend time reading some of Chopra's earlier works on this subject.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

Hagin will always be remembered as a champion of teaching the word of God. His whole life purpose was to teach Christians to have faith, which is simply trusting God at his word.<br /><br />With over 7000 promises to God's children concerning every aspect of life, Hagin spent his whole life pointing the believer to the Bible, as the revelation of God's will for our life. With his simple \\""God can't be a liar\\"" philosophy, millions have been touched, encouraged and healed, not by trusting Hagin's teachings, but by simply trusting God's word.<br /><br />This is the basis for one of the most wonderful spiritual based books ever released, Faith Food: Devotions by Kenneth E. Hagin. No matter what your background is, or what church you may go to, or denomination you belong to, Hagin simply, daily, points the reader to the word of God.<br /><br />Each day, he begins with a scripture, shares his insight into that scripture, and then ends the day with an affirmation of that thought and scripture to the reader's personal life.<br /><br />I bought the originals of this book some 20 years ago when they were published into four seasonal small paperback devotional booklets. They've gotten a lot of use since then and we were so pleased to see that they had been released in a hard bound book that I recently bought a copy, only to have my wife give it away to a daughter. So it looks like I'll have to get another copy. I recommend you do too for a daily, powerful, balanced walk through God's promises for his children.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

In other words, psychology has replaced the Cross. I think that this book that everyone seems to just \\""love\\"" and think that it's just the \\""answer\\"" to the church's problems is a complete work of psycho-heresy.  If you want to fulfill the call of Jesus Christ to preach and teach, making disciples of all nations, you must do one thing:  PREACH THE GOSPEL!  Why is everyone trying to mold people?  You can't change man, or the heart of man!  Only the Lord Jesus Christ, through His shed blood on the Cross and the power of His Holy Spirit can do that!  Our job as Christians, is to preach the Gospel.  We are also to show mercy, forgive, love, obey God in all things, be thankful to God for all things, however, if your faith is not in Jesus and Him Crucified and you are not walking in the Grace that that faith affords, you will not be able to love, show mercy, etc. (have fruit of the Holy Spirit).  I think that Mr. McCallum's time would be better spent reading the Bible and letting the Lord reveal His Word to him and HIs people.  Don't read this book it's a waste of time.  Instead, why don't you read the Gospels, found in the New Testament?  I guarantee that you will learn something new and be refreshed by the Holy Spirit through Word of God.

I studied psychology as an undergraduate but have been out of school for 6 years.  I studied intensively for probably 2 weeks prior to the exam.  I used the Kaplan book, the Princeton Review book and also a general psychology text (which if you buy a recently revised edition, you can find for under [...]  on amazon or[...].    The Princeton Review book was well organized and its outline/list format made it easy to follow.  The book covered a greater array of topics than the Kaplan book, but in MUCH less detail.  In fact, I often noted topics that were so glossed-over and summarized that they might actually misrepresent the term/concept to the reader unless he/she had a prior knowledge of the subject or did some additional studying.    The Kaplan book covered fewer topics but provided *slightly* more detail in its explanation. I found the content in the Kaplan book to align better with the content presented in the general psych text that I used (Gleitman's \\""Psychology\\""). Although it covers fewer specifics, it provides a much better review of main concepts.       In the end, I used both texts to make my own study guide by working through them both, section by section, and creating a combined list of terms/concepts I needed to study.  I did most of my actual studying using the general psychology book.      I would highly recommend using these two books to inform your study plan but do not rely on them to provide a complete review.  I found the general psychology text to be far more useful than either of these texts.  Let the review books guide your review by filtering the huge amount of information in the general psych book.    If you are very familiar with the material and just need a quick review, I would buy the Princeton Review book, as it presents more material overall.      If you are somewhat familiar with the material but need some serious review, I would at least buy the Kaplan book, as it provides better explanation of major concepts.    If you have the time, buy them both and invest in a general psych text.    Neither text can completely prepare you for the test. There were quite a few questions on the test that were not covered by either of the books and quite a bit of material that was heavily covered by both texts that did not appear on the test.  I'm sure ETS studies these books too.  Best of luck!    Good luck!","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

I particuarly like the compendium of non-action comics that Chris Ware compiled for McSweeny's 13.<br /><br />Ghost World seems to me more of an artifact of the 1990s than a lasting contribution to illustrated literature.  The book lacks any real punch to me know, in 2008.  Perhaps it is because the issues of this book have been so exhaustively covered in other literature and media, or perhaps it is because the issues of older teenagers have little relevance on my life as an adult, but this book just seemed to be primarily concerned with navel gazing.  The characters talk about how much they hate their lives, do little or nothing, and then repeat the next day.<br /><br />The only element that still rings true is how cruel and self-centered teenagers can be, even those who would like to think themselves better than their peers.<br /><br />The art was the highlight of the book for me, with Clowes uncluttered compositions and attention to detail brining a lot of life into his black and white panels.  Even the most mundane scenes are rendered visually interesting by Clowes.  It is a shame his writing is not on the same level.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

A man is drowning in a rushing river and shouts to a collie on the shore, &#34;Lassie -- go get help!&#34;  Panel two.

Nevertheless I am active in the spiritual/hermetic/esoteric/occultic arena. I purchased this set because through all of my other studies there are frequent references to Blavatsky's works so I thought it was time for me to read what she wrote.<br /><br />The first volume was a bit of a struggle for me. Blavatsky seems to make the assumption that when she refers to an event, place or person that the reader will instantly have intimate knowledge of what she is referring to and while that may have been true within her circle back in the late 19th century, it is no longer true and as a result many of the references are so obscure that the entire meaning is lost. In addition, Blavatsky often lets her own emotions/prejudices get the best of her and she rants endlessly on certain subjects based on nothing more then something that may have started out with a personality conflict between herself and others that she encountered. The second volume was a bit easier to read because so much of what she has to say has been repeated by many other authors over the years. The difference is that she has consolidated all of that knowledge into the second volume of this work.<br /><br />Having said all of that, I found the books amazing. She really does cut a very wide swath across the subjects she is dealing with and few authors cover as many different subjects in two volumes of this size. Of course, if she had taken time to fully annotate and footnote all of her various references in way that is useful to a modern student, the approximately 1300 pages would probably expand to well over 2500 pages and that is exactly where the work frustrated me. It is fine that she glosses over some point in the main text, but it would be nice if there were complete footnotes that explain the background for some of her pronouncements.<br /><br />At the same time there are definitely things in the book that are just plain wrong and we know better in modern times because information is just more readily available. Her ranting against Vampirism is just an example of this. When someone is gone, they are gone. We don't have to worry about driving wooden stakes through corpses to keep them in their grave. As for all of the seance matters that she rants about, such practices are far from the mainstream these days and the field is dominated by hoaksters. Sure, it makes people happy to think that they can communication with dead loved ones, but anyone who is a serious student of spirituality outside of religion would rather not be bothered with prevaricating elementals who have a good laugh at a human's expense.<br /><br />In any case, after reading these two volumes I am pretty sure that I want to pursue some studies in theosophy. Not so much because I want to become a hard core theosophist, but because I think the knowledge that they bring to the table may be very useful as filler material for my other studies.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

Stimulated by the coincidental purchase of a self-published book of radical epigrams by a \\""goldsmith of words,\\"" Gregorius takes trains for Lisbon, where Gregorius pursues the story of its author, Amadeu, a doctor during the Salazar post-war dictatorship. Putting aside his own mundane life of philology, \\""Mundus\\"" comes to excavate and relive the wordsmith's life through the recollections of his friends and family. Their two lives are radically disconnected from others, and expressed through the indeterminacy of \\""words,\\"" until one event apiece, mid-life crises, has jolted the characters to take real action.     This book is classified as a Mystery, but it is more about \\""secrets,\\"" the unknown history of a stranger newly met. No murder, no crooks, no \\""case.\\"" It is a fictional biographical exploration of two men enraptured by words; for Amadeu \\""bewitched by language, a wrong word meant more to him that a knife stab.\\"" Their lives would be very constrained were it not for the richness of the words through which we see them. Much of this double story takes place in the dark--the real night train?--for Gregorius is an insomniac. Although this is a \\""philosophical\\"" novel, all the characters are fully formed, not just mouthpieces for a particular view of Amadeu.     The exploration is couched by Mercier as an unremitting assault on one's sense of selfhood. Gregorius is always cast in the third person: we are observing him as he is studying the devastating passages written by atheist Dr. Amadeu that slash at our conventional concepts of friendship, family, and love. Mercier conducts us along the edge of the abyss, as he strives for precise words, fine distinctions, jewel-like phrases, and verbal conundrums that turn our common (unexamined) understanding on its head. This is not an easy book, or a fast read, for there is much for Mundus, and us, to ruminate upon in the writings of Amadeu, quoted extensively to drive Mundus to more interviews and deeper revelations.","2008-12-15","2008","Books"

Spence is the Sterling Professor of History at Yale University and is an expert on modern Chinese History (~1600-present).  In _The Death of Woman Wang_ Spence explores many facets of Chinese society during the later part of the 17th century.      The book examines three sources that focus on what in all honesty are historically insignificant events that took place in the obscure T'an-ch'eng county (Shandong province) over a span of four years (1668-1672).  Each of the three sources allow Spence to illuminate certain different aspects of Chinese society.  The sources and what they each reveal are as follows:  (1)  A Gazetteer compiled by an elite neo-Confucian scholar-bureaucrat (Jinshi) that recieved the highest possible...think of the gazetteer as state propaganda.  Spence draws from a section of the gazetteer entitled \\""Biographies of Virtuous Women.\\""  The biographies contain accounts of chaste women, some of whom committ suicide in order to preserve their virtue--the government praised them for doing so.    (2) A diary of the county's magistrate.  The gazetteer, because it is propaganda, is highly skewed.  The writings of the magistrate allow us to see how the laws and expectations of elite society translate to a rural reality.    (3) Third, are various works of fiction by the well known author P'u Sung-ling.  The most unorthodox of Spence's sources, P'u Sung-ling's stories allow insights into Chinese society that are not found in the more traditional sources.    Unlike most histories, this book focuses on people, events, and places that are unremarkable.   This approach ultimately allows the author to present a relatively complete view of Chinese society, including many of its problems.  Among the aspects that are present here are: Gender relations; knowledge about neo-Confucianism; the relationship between family and society; social problems such as natural disasters and banditry; and inner workings of the Chinese bureaucracy--notably tax collection.     If you are interested in Chinese society then you really need to read this book.  In apx 160 pages this book paints a complex and accurate picture of Chinese society in the late 17th century.

This book is not as in depth as Betts and Franklin's poetry reader (which is good for in class instruction) but it is a very good value. It has a lot of passages to read in it and is well organized. There are also english intros that give background details on the poems or passages.

Perhaps it's nothing more than the fact that we share a birthday (March 15th). Or maybe it's because he's generally regarded as one of the progenitors of the modern Democratic Party, of which I've been a member for almost 40 years. But now, after reading Newsweek editor Jon Meacham's rich, gracefully written biography of our seventh president, I've discovered new reasons to admire this colorful and controversial leader for the decisive role he played in shaping the modern presidency in the midst of a turbulent period of American history.    Drawing upon a diverse and impressive array of sources, including letters in private hands for 175 years, Meacham (like Jackson a Tennessean) paints what he describes as \\""not a history of the Age of Jackson but a portrait of the man and of his complex relationships with the intimate circle that surrounded him as he transformed the presidency.\\"" Born in humble circumstances and orphaned by the age of 14, Jackson rose to the pinnacle of power amidst the rude environment of the American frontier. He killed a man in a duel and was a ruthless military leader, whose victory over the British at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815 catapulted him to national prominence. After winning a plurality of the popular vote and then losing the 1824 election to John Quincy Adams in the House of Representatives, Jackson captured a decisive 56 percent majority in 1828.    Two dramatic political battles marked Jackson's presidency: the conflict surrounding the nullification doctrine advanced by the state of South Carolina and its chief advocate John Calhoun (Jackson's first-term Vice President), by which it claimed the right to reject laws passed by Congress, and the fight over the charter renewal of the Second Bank of the United States. Despite his belief in the principle of states' rights and the desirability of a limited federal government, Jackson maintained an unshakeable determination topreserve the unity of the new nation. \\""Convinced that the Union should stand strong, with the people at its mystical center,\\"" writes Meacham, \\""Jackson did not believe any amount of Southern sophistry --- as he would have seen it --- could destroy America.\\"" In the case of the Bank, Jackson saw himself as \\""the embodiment of the people standing against entrenched interests\\"" and prevailed in his effort to block the renewal of the Bank's charter, enduring withering criticism and the formal censure of the Senate in the process.    Meacham connects Jackson in a straight line to Abraham Lincoln, the next great president after a forgettable string of eight, ranging from mediocre to abysmal (Van Buren to Buchanan). Indeed there's even a link between the two, as Jackson named a 24-year-old Lincoln to the job of postmaster of New Salem, Illinois in 1833. Anyone not intimately familiar with the history of the Jackson era will come away from this account with an appreciation of the fact that had it not been for Jackson's determination to quell the threat of Southern secession there may have been no Union left for Lincoln to preserve a generation later.    While his portrayal of Jackson clearly is sympathetic, Meacham makes no attempt to deify his subject. Jackson was a slave owner, \\""blinded by the prejudices of his age,\\"" and never questioned the morality of that despicable practice. And he had no qualms about supporting the forced relocation of Native American tribes, culminating in the Cherokee \\""Trail of Tears,\\"" in which nearly a quarter of the Cherokee Nation disappeared. These less attractive aspects of Jackson's character are balanced against Meacham's portrait of \\""Old Hickory\\"" as a tender and attentive family man, dependent on his niece Emily Donelson, who served as White House hostess when Jackson's wife Rachel died shortly after the 1828 election, and her husband Andrew, his political confidante.    \\""The idea and image of a strong president claiming a mandate from the voters to unite the nation and direct the affairs of the country from the White House took permanent root in the Age of Jackson,\\"" Meacham concludes. Reading those words, it's hard not to appreciate their relevance on the eve of a new presidential administration owing its victory, in large measure, to an extraordinary grassroots campaign. Thanks to this wise and nuanced portrait of Andrew Jackson, it's possible to see the historical link between these eras, no matter how improbable the outcome might have appeared to Barack Obama's predecessor of nearly two centuries ago.    --- Reviewed by Harvey Freedenberg (mwn52@aol.com)","2008-12-15","2008","Books"
